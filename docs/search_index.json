In the Brain and Body Lab we are interested in how early experiences influence interactions between the brain and body, contributing to mental and physical health. We hope to use this information to improve the wellbeing of children, adolescents, and adults across the world. In other words, in the BABLab, we aim to do good science that makes a difference to people’s lives, today and tomorrow. The BABLab is directed by Dr. Bridget Callaghan, Assistant Professor of Psychology at UCLA. Current Projects: Mind, Brain, Body (MBB) Parenting Under Pressure (PUP) Inside Out Transfer Mental Health 1.1 Finding the Lab We’re located in the Psychology Department at UCLA! 5581 Pritzker Hall This is in the tower building, 5th floor. 1.2 Contact Info If you have any questions about the lab please contact the lab’s managers.

Download the desktop an mobile apps Please watch this tutorial HR Requirements Lab Manager must consult with Bridget prior to hiring. If for any reason a non-UCLA student is brought on, a background check must be run (~$50 each). Unless otherwise specified, the Lab Manager should refer to the RA application pool within UCLA students. This also applies to volunteers who have graduated from UCLA. Once a student volunteer has graduated, their status must be switched to staff volunteer and all HR paperwork should be resubmitted to reflect this change. A Background Check must also now be run, since the graduated student is technically no longer affiliated with UCLA on the date after their graduation. Please print, read, and complete the following forms located in Box (BABLAB/Lab/Documents/RA_hiring_documents/RA_hiring_forms_templates/HR documents) RA_volunteer_agreement RA_volunteer_application RA_volunteer_assignment RA_volunteer_workerscomp RA_volunteer_authorization (only if a Background Check is required) PAF form (obtained from HR) Each form MUST be completed thoroughly. Some persons omit information such as social security information, but if any area is left vacant, we cannot accept the forms and the volunteer will not be able to work on the UCLA campus. There must be a clear start date and a clear end date. The majority of the forms are filled out by the volunteer, but there are a few areas where the UCLA professor whose lab is overseeing the volunteer must sign and date as well. The volunteer may not work on the UCLA campus until all forms are filled out, signed, and submitted back to HR. Franz Access Email the lab manager to request weekend access if you will be running participants on the evenings/weekends Student volunteers: Include your name and Bruincard # Non-student volunteers: We will determine if you are eligible for an access card.

You might be wondering why we need a protocol for a lab meeting? The answer is simple – to make the meetings as time efficient, cohesive, and productive as possible. To achieve that goal, we follow a structured template for weekly lab meetings: 3.1.1.1 Meeting Blocks The first layer to the lab meeting structure is to have ‘Meeting Blocks’ which focus the content of our lab meetings for set periods of time (typically 3-5 weeks) on a particular topic. The topics of the Meeting Blocks are decided as a group and will be chosen for strategic purposes (e.g., if we are writing a grant or paper on a particular topic area we might assign a meeting block to that topic, likewise – if we are exploring measures for a new study, we could assign a meeting block to searching for a range of measures and deciding on the best available). You can find a list of potential Meeting Block topics at the end of this document. If there is a topic of high general interest to the lab, we can also schedule a meeting block on it (even if we don’t directly research that topic). At the end of each meeting block we will discuss the next block assignment as a group. If you have an idea for a meeting block, feel free to bring it up at the end of the current block (and add it to the list in this bookdown project). 3.1.1.2 Syllabus Development The first step in a meeting block will be to develop a syllabus for the coming weeks. The syllabus can either be worked on as a group (e.g., in the first meeting of a new block), or one person can be in charge of developing the syllabus. Roles &amp; Responsibilities Select a sub-topic or research question for each meeting within the block. Select a set of readings/material (can be movie clips, podcasts etc.) to go through each week (keep in mind that people have limited time to review the material for lab meeting so assign one primary reading/material and place add additional materials into a supplement, in case people wish to review further). Make a document for the meeting and share it with all meeting attendees. Make sure that people are signed up to lead each meeting in the block. Be in charge of sending reminders for the meetings in the block. Make any meeting notes at the end of each meeting, and make sure the paper doc is up to date at the close of the meeting. Make a post on the BABLab twitter for each meeting so people know what we are talking and thinking about. 3.1.1.3 Meeting Leaders Each meeting will be assigned a meeting leader. The leader is the person who has chosen or been assigned the primary reading or media material for that week. Roles and Responsibilities Read/watch/listen to the media assigned for that week in detail. Think about themes that can be brought up in the lab meeting to discuss as a group. Be ready to facilitate the meeting and stimulate conversation. Keep the meeting on track (practice those assertive conversation steering techniques!). The meeting leader does NOT need to make slides, prepare food, or do anything else beyond the roles and responsibilities outlined above. 3.1.1.4 Meeting Attendee It is not always possible to read/watch/listen to the media for every lab meeting in detail. That is why we assign one person (the meeting leader) to do a deep dive into the material each week. While a deep dive is not necessary, all meeting attendees are expected to be familiar with the media and topic of conversation each week so that they may contribute meaningfully to discussions. Roles and Responsibilities Familiarize yourself with the media being presented that week. If you have time, do a deep dive too. Be thoughtful in the lab meetings and try to make constructive comments. If you come across additional material that you think would be good to include in the lab meeting supplement, add it into the paper doc (on Dropbox). Try to connect the discussions in lab meeting with the past meetings in the current meeting block, as well as with discussions in past blocks. 3.1.1.5 Potential Lab Meeting Block Topics (in no particular order) Sensitive periods in learning and memory Mind Brain Body Study: Questionnaires Role of the hippocampus in learning and memory across development Nutritional Psychiatry Nutrition and cognitive development How does early adversity or lifetime stress affect the microbiome? Bottom up: microbiome influences on brain and behavior Top down: brain and behavioral influences on microbiome Mind Brain Body Study: In lab task review Multivariate analytical techniques in fMRI Microbiome methods Electrogastrograph – what do we know about the signal? Heart Rate Variability and early life stress Integrating physiological measures to enrich our understanding of behavior Kind of crazy ideas, but wouldn’t it be cool if they worked session. Research group highlight - we pick a research group (or even a general research topic) and review the body of work they engage in, or in the case of the research topic, who the big research groups in the field are. 3.1.2 Trainee Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays In order to encourage “deep work” time, we are implementing Trainee Tuesdays and Thursdays! All trainings, meetings, questions/concerns that will take longer than 10 minutes (unless URGENT) should be scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays if possible. Please feel free to schedule a meeting if you’d like to discuss your research/work more deeply or learn a new skill. If you are simply having an issue with an assignment, before you schedule a meeting with a lab manager we ask that you try the following steps in this order: Check the OSF protocol - there might be step-by-step instructions for your issue in the BABLab OSF or study specific OSF protocols Watch a training video - if one exists for the issue/task at hand Consult a fellow RA - they may know what to do Consult a senior RA Make a list of notes in your RA notebook about the problems you are having and present them for discussion at Thursday’s RA meeting Finally, schedule a one-on-one meeting with Emily or Kristen To do so, please create an event on the BABLab calendar. Please create this event on the blue BABLab calendar using the template below during a time the lab manager is free. Invite yourself and the lab manager you’d like to meet with! Title: Meeting - “Meeting topic” Description: “Brief meeting description” Guests: Individuals invited to the meeting Example: I (Emily) have also shared my personal calendar with the BABLab account, so you can see when I am available to meet with you. You can access it by selecting “Emily Towner” from “Other calendars” in the BABLab calendar. The off-white “busy” slots are times I am unavailable (doctor’s appointments, non lab-related meetings etc.). 3.1.3 Clinical Meetings Purpose The purpose of clinical meetings are to discuss and review ongoing clinical interviews (KSADs), troubleshoot any recent difficulties, and learn helpful interviewing tactics for future clinical interviews. During the meeting, you will present the team with background information from your clinical interview and walk through each supplement. What To Prepare Using a shared Dropbox Paper document, please prepare the following: Who you are presenting Participant’s KSADS file Date/time of session Brief background Was the child bio/adopted? Age of adoption Was there any prenatal exposure? Any trouble in school? Supplements Your thought process on why/why not you went through each supplements/diagnoses you have assigned Personal opinions What was the child participant like in the session? (note relevant behaviors for context) WASI/WIAT A quick overview of the participant’s WASI/WIAT (admission and scores) Questions for the team Any situations you feel may have been difficult to address during the clinical interview These meetings are also a safe space to debrief potentially difficult interviews. 3.2 Mail 3.2.1 USPS When sending things out USPS, you can place your recharge ID under the sender’s address, circle it, &amp; drop it in the outgoing mail bin in 1282 (faculty mailroom) 3.2.1.1 How to check your Charges Go to the MDDS ucla mail services check my charges page Click on MDDS Billing Data and sign in with your UCLA logon ID Navigate to the “Billing Activity Review” page At the Search bar: the financial services dept. code is 0875 and enter the appropriate recharge ID/month and year Under the Outgoing Mail Billing Activity, there will be a total cost of charges as well as number of pieces of mail for this FAU during the mobth/year you selected 3.3 Recycling &amp; Waste We can leave small items outside our door for recycling/trash pickup. For large items we should bring them to the A-level loading dock to be recycled. 3.4 Purchasing 3.4.1 PAC Orders PAC forms are used for most purchasing requests (besides Amazon which we can order from directly with our Amazon business account). Please consult the UCLA preferred vendors list first before submitting a PAC form for an outside vendor.

Otherwise, the order will remain in your fund manager’s queue until they are back in the office and able to approve orders. Business Order Information Enter the Full Accounting Unit (FAU) or Recharge ID in the Purchase Order (PO) Number field and enter a business justification in the Comments for Approver field. These fields are required for the Psychology Department. If this information is not provided, your fund manager will reject the order. NOTE: Business justifications must describe the purpose of items being purchased, how and where the items will be used. Please be sure to be as detailed and specific as possible. If you are purchasing an item flagged as restricted your fund manager may reach out to you for additional information. Restricted items are not necessarily unallowable, but may require additional levels of approval from the Pcard Administrator in Purchasing before we can charge it to a Pcard. Next, select the appropriate shipping address Next, you will select the method of payment. This should be a VISA with your fund manager’s name on the card.

Rename the link the exact name of the item as written on Amazon (or whatever website). Add a description with this format: Units: (insert amount of item, ex. 20 pencils) Orders: (insert how many orders placed, ex. 1 order of 20 pencils) Date submitted: (insert date we submitted order) Date placed: (insert date vendor has placed order) Date received: (insert date we got it in lab) If the card is something that may run out eventually (ex. granola bars, notebooks) add an approximate due date. Whenever an item has been submitted, placed, and in stock, move the card into its respective tab. Watch the video for a detailed explanation. 3.4.8 Fund Log - Lab Manager Items to add to the Fund Log TRELLO - amazon purchases reimbursements purchases in Box (uPrinting should be stored on box) petty cash staff reseracher salaries usps charges through mdds (participant payments, magic boxes) fedex charges through financial report/receipts Brian sends lamination - must email them for receipts DNA genotek on financial report (and they should send receipts for each PO) guest permits through emailing tyler 3.5 Technology 3.5.1 Slack If you haven’t already found this out for yourself, emails are a clunky way of communicating for most lab needs. Moreover, most people will find that they have a backlog of emails awaiting their attention. For this reason, we will use Slack for the primary means of lab communication. The beauty of Slack is that you only subscribe to the channels that concern you. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages. If you have to include out-of-lab recipients, use e-mail. If you have a paper you want to share, download it and then upload it to Slack in the #papers channel. Full-time lab members should install Slack on their computers and/or phones and check it regularly (during working hours). Part-time lab members should also check Slack when they are working in the lab as there may be important messages in there for them. Of course, if there is an emergency, and you need to contact Bridget, use her email or phone or drop into her office. Slack Channel Type Purpose #bablab_core Private For private communication between the core team - this includes the PI, Lab Managers, Postdocs, and Grad Students #bablab_ra Private For private communication between the lab managers and all the research assistants #bablab_senior_ra Private For private communication between the lab managers and the senior research assistants #diversity Public For lab-wide communication regarding lab commitment to diversity, inclusivity, and allyship #general Public For lab-wide communication and announcements #meetings_lab Public For notes or communication related to lab meetings #methods_fmri Public Sharing wisdom on fMRI data collection / analysis or asking (and answering) the fMRI questions of others #methods_mb Public Sharing wisdom on microbiome data collection / analysis or asking and answering the microbiome questions of others #notes_conferences Public For taking notes at conferences #papers Public Sharing links to lab-relevant papers and discussing them #random Public Non-work-related chatting – e.g., pics of pets, funny cartoons etc. #recruitment Public Any ideas you have for recruiting youth into our study #rejection_collection Public A collection of rejections and reflections! #stats Public To ask and answer questions about statistical analyses #study_inside_out Private To discuss issues related to the EGG and Emotionality study #study_pup Private To discuss issues related to the Parenting Under Pressure Study #study_mbb Private To discuss issues related to the Mind, Brain, Body study #study_transfer_mental_health Private To discuss issues related to the Transfer Mental Health Study #tips_coding Public Sharing wisdom on code writing or asking (and answering) the coding questions of others #writing_group Private For writing accountability and motivation 3.5.2 Box We have moved over to Box for our file storage service. This works very similarly to Google Drive or Dropbox, but is more secure. Additionally, each lab member can have their own account, it’s free and great for collaboration! Please download Box Drive to use. Click download for your operating system After installing, you may need to click allow in your security preferences Log in with your UCLA email (make sure to accept the Box sharing request first) Now you can use Box on your desktop. On the web version, change your notification preferences so that you don’t get an email every time someone uploads a file by unchecking the boxes below 3.5.3 Using Trello There are multiple lists on the Tasks Board! These include: Doing, To-do, Later and Done. Depending on the task, simply move it to the right list once you progress with it. To Do: Current tasks to complete. Doing: Tasks currently being done. Later: Tasks not as pressing, but still must be done. Done: Completed tasks. To add a card: Click ‘+ Add Another Card’ under the appropriate list. There are multiple functions within this: You can add members, labels (useful for studies), checklist, attachment, due date and more to the back of the card. This information will show when you click on the card. Show Menu function: This is a great way to search specific items, such as your own name for tasks, or the study for which there are tasks for, or tasks which have upcoming due dates. 3.5.4 Server In addition to Box, we make regular biweekly backups to a dedicated psychology department server (in addition to two external drives) To connect to the CallaghanLab server: *Contact the lab manager first to set up your credentials.

If everything was entered correctly from above, the mapped drive will appear under “Network locations” when you click on “Computer/This PC”. After the drive has been mapped, logged out of Windows to “logout” from the network drive. Don’t right mouse click on the mapped drive and select “Disconnect”. This will only unmap the network drive and you will have to go through the process all over again. To connect off-campus connect to the UCLA/BOL VPN and let it run in the background prior to logging into the mapped drive you had configured on your computer. How-to download/install the Cisco VPN client. Every night the server is backed up to the Life Sciences data center in Hershey Hall. That’s always been the case. To make those nightly backups more safe, there is another copy of the backups stored offsite (i.e. to prevent losing both the server AND the backups in a fire, earthquake, etc.) Once we have Shadow Copy enabled, we’ll also have more direct access to backups, so we won’t need to work with Life Sciences to retrieve backups. Psych IT will be able to grab a recent copy of your files/folders ourselves. We’ll also have access to incremental backups (i.e. yesterday’s copy, two day old copy, three day old copy…up to two weeks back). So at that point we’ll have 3 forms of backup, and plenty of safety net. Dave (Psych IT) 3.5.5 Dropbox Paper The lab has a shared Dropbox Paper account — which is slightly different than regular Dropbox file storage. On the Dropbox Paper, we will place collaborative documents. We will grant you access permission to various folders in the Dropbox Paper account, You may need to initialize an account with the email we grant access permission. 3.5.6 GitHub The lab’s GitHub should be used to share code and data with people outside of the lab (i.e., people not on our IRB). Not all data can be shared (because of IRB restrictions) and not all data that can be shared should be shared immediately. Speak with Bridget about when to share data, and what needs to be done to the data (e.g., the level of de-identification required) before we share it. Ask the lab manager to get access to the lab’s GitHub. Our lab manual, lab wiki, and study wikis are also hosted on our GitHub. 3.5.7 Google Calendars The lab has many Google calendars and you should subscribe to those that make sense for your unique situation. BABLab: Used for lab meetings, out of schedule meetings, birthdays, formal lab events etc. Availability: If you are part time, please place the hours you plan to come into the lab on this calendar. If you are going to be away, please place the dates and times on this calendar. This is critical as the lab manager will use this information when scheduling people to run participants for our studies. Bridget and the core team will also put her out of office times on this calendar to help people with scheduling. MBB: Used for booking sessions and reminders for the Mind, Brain, Body study The Bear’s Den: used to reserve time in experimental room 1 The Rainbow Room: used to reserve time in experimental room 2 A180 Testing Computer: the SAND Lab room that can be used for blood spots HPL1333: The Health Psychology Lab room that can be used for blood spots 3.5.8 E-mail We have an email listserv for communicating with the whole lab and individuals who subscribe to our list - including visitors and students from other labs who attend our meetings, visiting scholars, etc. The email is: bablab@googlegroups.com If you are thinking about joining the lab and would like to be notified about upcoming lab meetings, please request to join the listserv. There is also a lab email account which people use to contact the lab to participate in studies (bablab.ucla@gmail.com). This email account will be staffed by the lab manager/s and they will sort the emails in specific folders within the Gmail account. If you are running a study, it is your responsibility to check your study’s folder on the lab Gmail every few days and respond to participant inquiries in the “potential” participants folder in relation to your study. 3.5.9 Gmail Organization The bablab.ucla@gmail.com email is the lab email for all lab related correspondance. The email is organized with different folders and tabs for all lab and lab studies correspondance. Lab: Overarching tab for all lab functioning related emails Calendar: All emails about calendar events go in this tab (invitations to sessions, automatic emails Google sends about calendar events, etc) Other: Google Voice emails about missed calls or texts, anything not important that doesn’t belong in any other email tab Purchasing: Emails about purchases for lab, Amazon purchase confirmation emails RA_app_archive: Tab for RA applications that will not be reviewed anymore / not considering because it has been a long time since person initially expressed interest or otherwise outdated RA_app_ongoing: Tab for emails and app materials of individuals currently being interviewed for a position in the lab. Emails only stay in this tab during the hiring process and are then moved to either RA_app_archive or RA_applications RA_applications: Tab for recent RA applications that can be reviewed if we’re looking to hire someone Save: Tab for important emails that don’t fit anywhere else Security: Tab for emails from Zoom about accessing calendar, security alert emails from Google, and any other security related emails Recruitment: Overarching tabs for all emails about recruitment Ads: Tab for emails about any ads we run – Facebook, Instagram, Craigslist, Patch, Nextdoor, etc. Community_contacts: Tab for emails with organizations or individuals we’ve reached out to for potential collaborations ( e.g. Influencers, community partners) Studies: Overarching label for the folders of differnt studies in lab Inside_Out: Tab that has all correspondence related to Inside Study previously completed in the lab Mind_brain_Body: Tab for all correspondence related to ongoing longitudinal Mind Brain Body Study Parenting_Under_Pressure: Tab for correspondence related to Parenting Under Pressure study previously completed in lab Mind_Brain_Body: Tab with all emails related to the Mind Brain Body study Added: Tab for emails with individuals we’ve added to the participant database but that aren’t enrolled in MBB; interest forms that participants fill out on website MBB_online_scheduled: Emails with participants that are enrolled in MBB Wave 1 online MBB_Wave_2: Emails with all the people that are now in Wave 2 of MBB (either already enrolled in Wave 2 or we are in contact about enrolling them in Wave 2) Potential: Tab where correspondence goes for anyone that has not been added to REDCap or our participant database but is interested in the Mind Brain Body study. Testimonials: We add this label to any email thread that has a testimonial about MBB (we sometimes ask participants if they’d like to give a testimonial for website) 3.5.10 ListServ Protocol: Adding MBB Participants to the BabLab Newsletter Google Group The Brain and Body Lab has a Newsletter Google Group where we send previous study participants newsletters and updates regarding the research within our lab, and it is important to consistently add new study participant emails to this list, so they can receive our newsletters!

Because this computer has the Acknowledge software installed on it, and has the USB Key for that program you need to use that computer for processing any physiology data. If you are off campus, you can VPN to the computer using the following steps. NB: you will need to have downloaded Cisco Anyconnect - you can access that by clicking here Step 1. Open Cisco and type ‘ssl.vpn.ucla.edu’ and press ‘connect’ Step 2. Type in your UCLA ID and Password (same as you use to get into email) Step 3. Accept the SSO push to your second device Step 4. Click ‘Accept’ Step 5. Go to the magnifying glass at the top right of your screen and search for Screen Sharing. Step 6. Type in the IP address for the Bear Den computer: 164.67.125.42 Step 7. Type in the username and pw for the Bear Den computer: Username - Brain &amp; Body Lab PW - BaBLaB Step 8. You will see a new window pop up, with a desktop, which is the desktop of the Bear Den computer. A second option would be to go to the Finder on your Mac, on the top menu bar click ‘Go’ and then click ‘Connect to Server’. Type in vpn://164.67.125.42. This will take you straight to the screen sharing page where you can then perform Step 7 &amp; 8 from above. 3.5.17 Google Voice Go to the app store and search for Google Voice and download the app. The app icon should look like the picture. When you open the app you will be given the option to choose what account to sign into for Google Voice. Click on add another account to add the BaB lab account. If you are already signed into the BaB lab email on your phone then it will likely already show the account as a sign-in option. That will open this window in the app and you’ll sign into the BaB lab account. Once you’re signed in it will show you this page to choose your phone number. Choose skip since your phone number won’t be an option yet. Now go to settings by clicking the three bars on the top left of the main page of Google Voice. Click on devices and numbers to add your phone number to send and receive calls from your phone. Note: There are some pre-chosen settings like “ forward messages to email” do not change those.

There is a lot of content to keep track of and to ensure is posted weekly. General important rules: Keep posts short, family-friendly, and accessible. If you post on the story, it should also likely be added to a story highlight. Stick to the color scheme and aesthetic (this includes matching the text in story highlights to the story highlight cover color). Maintain the integrity of the main feed grid (will be elaborated on further down). Maintain the consistency of the Lab’s hashtags (will be elaborated on further down). Feed Content: The feed grid is an important part of the aesthetic of the lab’s social media. We can divide the grid into “A Week” and “B Week” rows. Because there are 3 posts horizontally in the grid, there should be 3 pieces of content posted each week (or with relative consistency). “A Week”: Biome Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week’s Biome Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post. Lab Meeting ad post OR Email List ad post: Post this on lab meeting day in “A Week”. If there is a speaker or specific topic for the week, discuss that briefly in the caption. In “B Week”, don’t post this even if there is a lab meeting. Instead, post a previous Lab Meeting ad post on the story. If there is not a lab meeting during that “A Week”, you should post the Email List ad post instead. Brain Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week’s Brain Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post. “B Week”: 3 random posts: post pictures from around the lab, from events, or advertisements for upcoming events. Check the existing feed for ideas, and try to stay current with seasons, trends, etc. If there is an event upcoming, use the following template to advertise it. Important notes for all feed content: Post all posts to both instagram and facebook (integrated feature on insta) End every single post with the following: #brain Add 2-3 topical hashtags on the new line afterwards, and then follow that with the following block of hashtags: #funscience #psychology #neuroscience #research #lablife #ucla #gutbiome #dev #psych #brain #body #adolescence #childhood #ela #losangeles #scientist Story Content: Q&amp;A Monday: every Monday, post the Q&amp;A Monday story with instagram’s questions feature attached. Check periodically throughout the day to see if there are any questions worth responding to. Post any responses on the Q&amp;A story highlight. Biome Bites!: A weekly fun fact about the microbiome. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight. Lab Meeting ad: on lab meeting days, post one of the ad posts on the story. Brain Bites!: A weekly fun fact about the brain/developmental psych. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight. Contact Story ad: on Fridays, post the contact story post. When events are coming up, be sure to post frequently on the story about the date, time, and what activities we will be doing. There is a whole series of story templates made to show off different activities and share information regarding the event. Where to Find the Designs: All of the above designs for social media posts are on our canva site. If you need to adjust any of the designs, feel free to do so. 3.7.2 Facebook Most of the content will carry over from instagram because the accounts are linked. Just ensure that you stay active with checking notifications and responding to comments. Consistency across all of the lab materials is the most important thing to maintain for our online footprint. If you are unsure of what a post should look like, check out previous posts and highlights for ideas! 3.8 Recruitment 3.8.1 Facebook Ads One way we recruit participants for MBB is by running ads on Facebook through our lab page. Below is all the relevant information for running a Facebok ad. Facebook has been successful for recruiting parents. First go the Brain and Body Facebook page and click on the Ad Center tab. Once on the ad center click on Create Ad Choose “create new ad” for choose ad type. Do not choose the automated ad option because the Facebook algorithm doesn’t understand our ad needs. For goal choose “get more website visitors” or if promoting a post choose “get more page likes” Fill in the ad description keep the description short and general do not mention payment or other words that could cause the ad to be flagged ( mention of money, els related words like adopted or gaurdianship children) typically bablab email is included so they can contact us 5.1. Add ad picture by clicking choose image the picture should also have minimal writing so it runs successfully it is okay to say adopted / guardianship in the picture since picture words won’t get flagged include the irb approval line at the bottom of ad picture when making it on Canva Put the url for the lab website page you want to direct participants to. For audience chose “People you choose through targeting” and click the pencil to edit the audience. Choose a location for ad to run and add appropriate filters to further target individuals examples of filters used: adoption, parents, parents with young childrenm international adoption it is best to start with a bigger audience and then fine tune filters as needed Choose how long you want the ad to run let it run for at least three days and a budget of at least $3 a day to maximize chances of it running well. Look at the ad previews to make sure everything is correct and the picture is not cropped incorrectly This gives an estimate of the ammount of people we will reach and how much it will cost. Once done looking through it click the submit button at the bottom of the page. 3.8.2 Instagram Ads Another way we recruit participants for MBB is by running ads on Instagram through our lab page. Below is all the relevant information for running an Instagram ad. Instagram has been successful for recruiting teens and young adults but not very successful for recruiting lots of parents thus far. To run an instagram ad you need to promote a post. Click the plus sign on top right corner of screen then choose post. Choose picture and click next. On next page it gives you options for filters, just skip that. Write the caption for the post you’ll be promoting. Click on the “create a promotion” button to make a promotion from the post. Click share to post the picture to our IG account. keep the caption short and try to avoid words that could get the ad flagged Once the post has been shared to our IG page it should take you directly to the promotion settings. On this page you’ll choose the goal for the ad. Choose “more website visits” and make sure the link is correct Here you will define your audience. If audience is els you can choose the ELS filter we previously made. 5.1 If making a new audience filter then choose Create your own 5.1 If creating your own filter ad in location you want for the ad and some filters of who you are trying to target. Examples: parents, parents with young children, adoption it is best to start with a bigger audience and then fine tune filters as needed Choose how long you want the ad to run let it run for at least three days and a budget of at least $3 a day to maximize chances of it running well On the last page it gives you a summary of the ad. Look over it before submitting the promotion. Lab manager may need to provide payment info to complete transaction. 3.8.2.1 Getting Ad Receipts Getting Facebook Ad Receipt Go to the business Suite from the BAB Lab page Click on more tools. Go to billing option which should open up in a seperate tab. If there is an outstanding balance then pay by clicking pay now. After paying the transaction should show up at the top of the list and you can download the receipt using the arrow button. Getting IG Ad receipt In the IG app, click on the plus sign. Click on settings on the popup options that will show up. Click on promotion payments If you have already been charged/ paid for the latest ad then click on the Transaction History tab. 4.1. If the top has an outstanding balance then pay by clicking the pay now button. After paying you can click the Transaction History button. Once on transaction history click on the date of when the latest ad was paid for. Click the download button to download the receipt. In most cases you can redirect so it opens on a different page and you can email it to yourself or save as a pdf. 3.8.3 Craigslist posting Login into Bablab’s craigslist account. See internal of Lab website for login info Click on “create a posting.” Click the option “community”: DO NOT choose “gig offered” because you have to pay for these advertisements. The community option is free Choose “volunteers”. Fill out this page based on the research study. Type “Los Angeles” for the city and the postal code 90095. Then press continue and post it! 3.9 Research Assistant Hiring 3.9.1 Not hiring If we are not looking for research assistants, please respond to any inquiries with the following template. [BAB - NOT HIRING] 3.9.2 Hiring If we are looking for research assistants, please follow the protocol below. Qualified candidates should be invited to fill out our form using the folowing template. [BAB - INVITE APPLY] Candidates to be interviewed should be invited to interview using the following template. [BAB - INTERVIEW] Candidates we wish to extend an offer to should be emailed using the following template. [BAB - OFFER] Once hired, there are several email templates to welcome/onboard members to the team. Please send the email and follow the instructions in the prompt. [BAB - ONBOARDING STUDENT] [BAB - ONBOARDING NON-STUDENT] "],["research-protocols.html", "Section 4 Research Protocols 4.1 Data Management 4.2 Ethics 4.3 Questionnaire Database 4.4 Interviews 4.5 Tests 4.6 Behavioral Coding 4.7 Physiological Measurement 4.8 ASA 4.9 Gorilla 4.10 Git 4.11 GitHub 4.12 OSF 4.13 Wiki Creation", " Section 4 Research Protocols 4.1 Data Management 4.1.1 Storing Active Datasets Lab data can be stored on Box, the psychology department server, and on external hard drives and CD’s. Any data with personally identifying information can only be stored on non-networked, encrypted, external harddrives, flash drives, and CD’s. Although the the data is routinely backed up, the backup is only on-site – so make extra backups! Each lab member should back up raw data on an external hard drive, as well as the code needed to reproduce all analyses. You should not store data locally on your computer (but logging into your Box/server account on your computer is ok). 4.1.2 Data Organization General notes on file naming: It is very important that files are named in a clear and consistent way to avoid confusion Generally, versions of data files, scripts, etc. that are kept in study folders are final versions, meaning that they are “master” copies rather than versions that are being edited by individual lab members. If you would like to edit a script for some reason, please copy it to your user folder and rename it adding _&lt;your initials&gt;, eg., _fq to mark it as being edited by you. If we would like to use it for general study use, it will need to be checked and approved. If the check is successful and it is approved, only then can it replace the “master” script and the initials be removed. Data should generally be named in the following way: &lt;measure&gt;_&lt;status&gt;_&lt;if relevant, date in form YYYYMMDD&gt;_&lt;if personal copy, initials&gt; (e.g., cbcl_raw_20201118_fq). Date is the date the data file was generated. If it was generated by a script, date needs to be updated each time the script is run. If you have already run several independent projects and have a data organization structure that works well for you, feel free to use it. If not (or if you are looking for a change), the following structure is recommended (based on Neuropipe): projectName/subjects individual directories for each of your participants projectName/subjects/{subj}/analysis subject-specific analyses (e.g., 1st and 2nd level analysis – at the run level and experiment level) projectName/subjects/{subj}/data raw data for that participant, with the following directories… behavioralData (for, well, behavioral data) eyetrackingData (if applicable) nifti (raw nifti files / raw MRI and fMRI data) rois (participant-specific ROIs) projectName/subjects/{subj}/design timing files for that participant, with different directories for the different GLMs you’re running (and the different runs in the experiment) projectName/subjects/{subj}/fsf if you’re using FSL, put the .fsf fies here. If you’re using SPM or something else, save the files for setting up preprocessing and GLMs here projectName/subjects/{subj}/scripts Matlab, Python, R, or bash scripts that you used for that participant. You should keep the ‘template’ scripts elsewhere, but you can store scripts you modified specifically for that participant here projectName/scripts template scripts and that you may modify for each participant, as well as scripts and functions used for all participants and group analyses recommend making subdirectories for each type of analysis (e.g., behavior, pattern analysis, functional connectivity, univariate) if you have scripts that are the same for each participant, you can have symbolic links for them in your participant-specific scripts directories naming convention for scripts: Note that BABLab has decided on this naming conventions for scripts - &lt;measure or study&gt;_&lt;purpose&gt;_&lt;if personal copy or editing, initials&gt; (examples: mbb_cleaning_fq, cbcl_scoring_fq) projectName/results figures with main results, powerpoint or keynote presentations, manuscripts if you wish projectName/notes detailed notes about the design, analysis pipeline, relevant papers, etc projectName/group group analyses recommend making subdirectories for each type of analysis (e.g., behavior, pattern analysis, functional connectivity, univariate) projectName/task code for your behavioral experiment, stimuli, piloting information if you are running your presentation code off of the server, it will still be good to have a copy of the code here (but you can keep the stimuli only on the server if you’d like) When you leave the lab, your projects directories should be set up like this, or something similarly transparent, so that other people can look at your data and code. You must do this, otherwise your analysis pipeline and data structure will be uninterpretable to others once you leave, and this will slow everyone down (and cause us to bug you repeatedly to clean up your project directory or answer questions about it). Agreed upon organizational structure specific to MBB: /../Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Scripts/&lt;wave&gt;/Data: This contains all data that are used in the scripts (including raw data, inputs, and outputs of the scripts). Each file needs to be named clearly (see naming convention for data above). /../Studies/Mind_Brain_Body/Scripts/&lt;wave&gt;/&lt;purpose, eg. scoring&gt;/&lt;if necessary, sub-folder for measure&gt;: scripts go here (e.g., /Scripts/Wave1/scoring/cbcl would contain script to score the cbcl) 4.1.3 Archiving Inactive Datasets Before you leave, or upon completion of a project, you must archive old datasets and back them up. We will develop the instructions for this when we reach our first inactive dataset. 4.2 Ethics 4.2.1 IRB Consent, Assent, and Screening Links to templates from the UCLA research administration group. 4.2.1.1 How to request an IRB account Click here for steps on how to request of an IRB account 4.2.2 IBC What is the IBC? The IBC is the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which has the same purpose as the IRB but specific to research involving biohazards materials. The IBC is an arm of the UCLA Environment Health &amp; Safety office (EH&amp;S). How to Apply for Approval DBS approval and approval to collect any other biological samples is processed through UCLA SafetyNet, the IBC online system, which is the IBC’s equivalent to webIRB. SafetyNet is accessible here with UCLA logon ID. IBC approval IS needed for blood samples IBC approval IS NOT needed for saliva, stool, or hair samples unless — Saliva is collected from dental procedures Stool or hair samples are contaminated with blood or infected with pathogens (e.g. HBV, HIV) Once signed in, a new protocol is created by clicking ‘Create BUA’. A BUA is a Biological Use Authorization, which is synonymous with IBC protocol. Completing the BUA is just like completing an IRB protocol, but with a focus on the collection of biological samples. A BUA (or IBC protocol) requires the following document in addition to information supplied in the online form: Lab Specific Biosafety Manual (includes the following) Laboratory Specific SOPs (based on general template available here) Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan (based on general template available here) NOTE: Consultation with an EH&amp;S is likely necessary to complete the BUA protocol. Contact EH&amp;S or IBC employees with questions at biosafety@ehs.ucla.edu or ibc@research.ucla.edu. All EH&amp;S documents are available here. Additional documents may be required depending on the kind of biological material that’s going to be collected. Once a BUA is completed, it will appear under ‘Submissions.’ IBC staff may require that modifications be made to the protocol, just as the IRB would. You may reply to modification requests and make modifications in the same way that you would for an IRB protocol, by logging your response to a reviewers comment and then making the necessary change in the protocol itself. Once all modifications are made, there are two more requirements before a BUA can be approved: Staff involved in collecting biological samples must acquire necessary training Training may be completed via the UCLA WorkSafe portal accessible with UCLA logon ID. For Dried Blood Spot collection, the following trainings are required of any staff working directly with samples: NIH Guidelines for UCLA Researchers IBC Compliance Training (online) Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (online) Blood-borne Pathogens Training (online) Medical Waste Management (online) Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) (online) Biosafety ABC’s - Biosafety Level 2 Training (in-person) The PI is required to complete two courses : NIH Guidelines for UCLA Researchers: IBC Compliance Training (online) Laboratory Safety for PIs and Lab Supervisors (in-person) Training must be up to date. Training certificates are maintained on the BAB Lab Box at BABLAB/Lab/Training/IBC A room inspection must be done to approve the use of physical space for sample collection and storage. The room inspection is arranged directly with EH&amp;S staff. 4.3 Questionnaire Database In Box you can find a questionnaire database for the BABLab. This is different from the study specific questionnaire folders! This database is a repository for all of the questionnaires we have used or thought about using in our research. Organizing them here makes it easy for future BABLab members to plan, organize, and reproduce studies! This includes the questionnaires used in all of our studies, including source material. In addition, the questionnaire database excel file contains information such as a brief description and reference (needed for IRB protocols and the like). You can find the questionnaire database at the following path: Box/BABLAB/Lab/Questionnaires You can find the questionnaire database spreadsheet at the following path: Box/BABLAB/Lab/Questionnaires/Questionnaire_database.xlsx When making a new study, please add your questions to the database, including a category and a reference! Adding a category makes it easy to filter this sheet by category when exploring measures. Please create a folder for each questionnaire within the database to allow for the organization of source material. For example, the scq (social cravings questionnaire) was adapted from the fcq (food cravings questionnaire). Therefore, in the scq folder I included the original measure for the fcq, and a paper in which it is desribed and validated. In addition, if you have created this questionnaire as an instrument in REDCap - please upload the zipped file of the instrument to this folder! This will save a great deal of time for future researchers! 4.4 Interviews 4.4.1 KSADS Align expectations from the start (semi-structured interview) Encourage brief responses Can write down details later Dive in and direct participant Read the threshold criteria 4.5 Tests 4.5.1 WASI 4.5.1.1 WASI Administration Ensure you have all necessary materials (WASI/WIAT administration instruction sheet, WASI score sheet, pencil with NO eraser, WASI administration booklet, WASI score book) Part I: Vocabulary General Instruction: You will be pointing to each item in the WASI administration booklet and asking the child/adolescent what this item is/if they can describe what this item means to you Start audio recording Flip the WASI administration booklet to page 41, item #4 (what is a shirt?)

With each heartbeat, an electrical signal travels through the heart. This electrical wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart. ECG measures this wave through electrodes placed across the torso. By collecting ECG, you can detect changes in heart function due to certain stimuli. Things like stress, excitement, fear, and other emotional responses can be physiologically measured based on changes in the ECG readouts. Biopac Setup In our ECG setup, we have one transmitter with one channel. The red and white leads are the signal, the black lead is the ground. Because we are using a wireless setup, there needs to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Electrode Placement We will be placing 2 electrodes just below the collarbones and one electrode on the lowest left rib. Filtering and Signal Frequency We will sample ECG at a rate of 2kHz, or 2000 samples/second. This gives us a resolution high enough to catch all of the important parts of the heartbeat waveform. Noise is not much of an issue with collecting ECG in a 3-electrode setup. Subject Position Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position, so that body movement can be completely avoided or reduced to the minimal. The subject should be asked not to talk, move, read or make phone calls during the procedure. Ensure that the position of the subject is the same if there are multiple sessions. Timing of unavoidable body movement or motion artifacts should be noted and the recording periods with motion artifacts must be removed before analysis. Gathering ECG Data Lightly abrade the skin at the electrode sites with EL-Prep Gel Wipe off excess with a wet wipe or tissue After prepping the electrodes with Gel-100, attach electrodes to the skin at the three positions indicated above Let these sit as long as possible to adhere and for the gel to soak in Ask the participant to put on the module like a belt around their torso Make sure the electrode lead inputs are pointed up towards their head Connect the white lead to the Right Collarbone electrode, connect the black lead to the Left Collarbone electrode, and connect the red lead to the Left Rib electrode Turn on the transmitter and ensure that both the light on the Biopac receiver module and the transmitter are green (the transmitter should be flashing, whereas the receiver should be solid) Make sure there is a clear, unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and receiver antenna Open AcqKnowledge by selecting the template file on the desktop If the system is not connected to the hardware, make sure the wifi is turned off and restart AcqKnowledge Ensure all devices are connected and lead wires attached properly Hit the green “Start” button and click through all of the dialog boxes that you’re prompted with 4.7.2 EGG Biopac Setup In our EGG setup we have one transmitter with two channels (A and B). The white leads are the reference, the red are the signal, and the black is the ground. Each transmitter needs to have a ground. Because we are using a wireless setup, there needs to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Electrode Placement We will place the two white electrodes side-by-side on the xyphoid (which is the lower part of the sternum). We will place the two red electrodes in position 1 and 4 in the diagram above. We will place the black electrode (the ground) on the second from bottom rib on the left. Try to get it over the bone as much as possible. Position 1 should be in line with the reference electrode, and position 4 should be in line with the ground. Next, we need to have the transmitter up high on the participants chest so there is line of sight between the transmitter and receiver (antenna). Alternative: Regular electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes can be used for EGG recordings. The most commonly used configuration for recording 1-channel EGG is to place one electrode at the midpoint on a line connecting the xiphoid and umbilicus, and the other electrode 5 cm away (up and 45 degree) to the patient’s left. The ground electrode is placed on the left costal margin horizontal to the first active electrode. Filtering and signal frequency Amplification: the EGG signal is usually in a range of 50-500 μV and adequate amplification needs to be provided by a recording device so that the amplified signal is of an appropriate range for display and analysis Filter setting: determines the frequency range of the EGG signal to be maximally amplified. The interested range of the EGG signal is in the range of 0.5-9.0 cpm or 0.0083 to 0.15 Hz which is much lower than that of most of extracellular recordings. In addition to the basic fundamental frequencies of 0.5-9.0 cpm, it is also important to record certain harmonics (multiples of the fundamental frequency). Accordingly, an appropriate frequency setting is in the range of 0.0083 to 1 Hz. Skin Preparation First, the abdominal skin where the electrodes are to be positioned should be thoroughly cleaned to ensure that the impedance between the pair of electrodes is below 10 kΩ. To do so, it is advised to abrade the skin until it turns pinkish using some sandy skin-preparation jelly, and then apply a thin layer of electrode jelly for 1 minute for the jelly to penetrate into the skin. Before placing the electrode, the excessive jelly must be completely wiped out. Subject Position Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position, most commonly supine, so that body movement can be completely avoided or reduced to the minimal. The subject should be asked not to talk, move, read or make phone calls during the procedure. Ensure that the position of the subject is the same if there are multiple sessions. Timing of unavoidable body movement or motion artifacts should be noted and the recording periods with motion artifacts must be removed before analysis. Duration of Recording A common mistake in recording the EGG is that the recording is too short. Unlike the ECG in which there are about 60 waves every minute, the EGG is composed of only 3 waves every minute. That is, if the recording is of a short duration of 5 minutes, there are only 15 waves which are obviously insufficient for analysis and interpretation. Ideally, at least a 30-minute period is needed to ensure an accurate measure of gastric slow waves in a particular state, such as fasting, fed, baseline or after intervention. Meals We will ask participants to eat something about 1 hour before they come into the lab. Then we will give them water (as a test meal) immediately before performing the EGG. The subjects should all drink the same amount of water. Analysis The EGG also contains respiration artifact that is between 12-25 cpm and sometimes the ECG artifacts (＜ 60 cpm). Occasionally, the slow wave of the small intestine may also be recorded in the EGG (9-12 cpm). Although these interferences distort gastric slow waves in the EGG, their frequencies do not overlap with that of the gastric slow waves. Consequently, spectral analysis can be performed to separate the gastric slow waves from interferences. Before spectral analysis is performed, any periods with motion artifacts must be identified and deleted because motion artifacts can not be separated from the gastric slow waves even with spectral analysis. So we will need to record their motion during the task. Dominant Frequency and Power The dominant frequency and power of the EGG can be derived from the power spectral density assessed by the periodogram method. The normal range of the dominant frequency of the EGG is between 2 to 4 cpm. The EGG is called bradygastria if its dominant frequency is lower than 2 cpm, tachygastria if its dominant frequency is higher than 4 cpm but lower than 9 cpm, and arrhythmia if there is no dominant peak power in the spectrum Power Ratio or Relative Electrogastrography Power Change: The ratio of dominant EGG powers after and before an intervention is a commonly used parameter that is associated with alteration in gastric contractions. It is generally accepted that a ratio of ＞ 1 reflects an increase in gastric contractility due to the intervention, whereas a ratio of ＜ 1 reflects a decrease in gastric contractility. If the decibel (dB) unit is used, the ratio should be replaced by the difference between the baseline and after intervention. Percentage of Normal Gastric Slow Waves: The percentage of normal slow waves is a quantitative assessment of the regularity of the gastric slow wave measured from the EGG. It is defined as the percentage of time during which normal gastric slow waves are observed in the EGG. The percentage of normal slow waves can be computed from the running power spectra of the EGG. In this method, 1 spectrum is derived from every 1 minute (or some other short period) of EGG data; the minute is considered normal if its EGG spectrum exhibits a dominant power in the range of 2-4 cpm. In humans, the normal percentage of gastric slow wave is defined as 70%. Percentage of Gastric Dysrhythmia: The percentage of gastric dysrhythmia is defined as the percentage of time during which gastric dysrhythmia is observed in the EGG. It is computed in the same way as that for the percentage of normal slow waves. It is further classified into the percentage of bradygastria, the percentage of tachygastria and the percentage of arrhythmia. 4.7.3 GSR Electrodermal response (EDR) measurements (including Galvanic Skin Response, GSR) show the activity of the eccrine sweat glands. Typically, one will place electrodes where the concentration of these glands is the highest: namely, the fingertips. The activity of the eccrine sweat glands as a response to physiological excitation (stress, fear, etc.) serves to increase the conductivity of the skin when activated. When one applies a very small electric voltage (0.5 V) between two electrodes, the manifested electrical conductance varies in direct proportion to the electric current flowing between the electrodes. For instance, if a subject is presented a stimulus and the palms start to sweat, this response indicates a highly-stimulated state. The EDR of this subject will then be higher than the subject’s baseline. If another subject receives the same stimulus and the palms remain as “cool as a cucumber,” the EDA reading will remain unchanged with respect to the baseline. EDR undergoes relatively fast habituation (decrease of amplitude) in the event the same stimulus is repeated over and over to the same subject. Biopac Setup In our GSR setup, we have one transmitter with one channel. The red lead is the signal, the black lead is the ground. Because we are using a wireless setup, there needs to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Electrode Placement We will be placing the signal electrode on the middle finger of the child’s non-dominant hand. This has been noted to be the region of the hand with the most concentrated and reactive eccrine sweat glands, and using the non-dominant ensures that the participants will be able to continue with other activities that they may be tasked with while hooked up to the GSR module. The ground electrode can be attached anywhere within reach of the transmitter leads. While the above paper grounded to a position on the participant’s arm, for the sake of consistency and simplicity, we are attaching the second electrode to the participants’ index finger (on the same hand). This provides an effective ground, consolidates the leads into one area (preventing potential interference or having the electrodes pulled off by strain on the leads), and also standardizes the placement across all the participants. Filtering and Signal Frequency BioPac Recommendation The sample rate can be set quite low for long-term ambulatory measurements or experiments that do not require a high level of temporal precision (i.e., 1-5 samples per second). However, lower sample rates cannot ensure that specific events are accurately represented in what is relayed and graphed, and a degree of timing error might occur. To avoid this, BioPac recommends the sampling rate be set to a minimum of 2000 samps/sec (2KHz). Higher sample rates are useful for a number of methodological reasons and for improvements in precision. For EDA/GSR measurements, it is typical to filter the data at 35Hz. Some recommendations are that a sample rate of 200Hz - 400Hz are a minimum to ensure enough samples for accurate separation of phasic waveforms from tonic signals and a more accurate representation of signal shape. A general approach is to always err on the side of caution and probably seek to sample higher than you really need. As a general rule 1000Hz - 2000Hz sample rates are more than sufficient and easily achievable. The decision for the present study is to collect at a sampling rate of 2000Hz. Subject Position Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position, so that body movement can be completely avoided or reduced to the minimal. The subject should be asked not to talk, move, read or make phone calls during the procedure. Ensure that the position of the subject is the same if there are multiple sessions. Timing of unavoidable body movement or motion artifacts should be noted and the recording periods with motion artifacts must be removed before analysis. Gathering GSR Data Don’t abrade the skin After prepping 2 electrodes with a dab of Gel101, attach them to the child’s middle and ring fingers Let these rest to let the adhesive set and gel soak in for 5 minutes Ask the child to put on the PPGED transmitter like a wrist watch. Assist if needed. Attach the transmitter leads to the electrodes (red to middle, black to pointer) These should be the only two leads connected to the device If there are more leads present, ensure you have the correct transmitter and that the correct lead set is plugged in Turn on the transmitter and ensure that both the light on the Biopac receiver module and the transmitter are green (the transmitter should be flashing, whereas the receiver should be solid) Make sure there is a clear, unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and receiver antenna Open AcqKnowledge by selecting the template file on the desktop If the system is not connected to the hardware, make sure the wifi is turned off and restart AcqKnowledge Ensure all devices are connected and lead wires attached properly Hit the green “Start” button and click through all of the dialog boxes that you’re prompted with 4.8 ASA Loading Users into ASA Protocol ASA is a 24-hour dietary assessment tool that we use as part of MBB for participants to enter information regarding their diet and generate a nutrition report. Each MBB participant requires their own unique ASA username and password to complete this task. To load new users into ASA: Go to the following website: https://asa24.nci.nih.gov/ Log in using username and password found on the BabLab Internal Site. Click on “Respondent Accounts” to add new accounts to ASA Click “Start Wizard” to set up additional account usernames and passwords. Respondent usernames will automatically begin with MBB and an ID number of your choice. Confirm with Lab Manager what the MBB ID numbers should be for the study, and how many participants accounts should be created. Because participants complete ASA for different waves, the MBB ID numbers need to be different for each Wave. Ex: Wave 1 MBB participant usernames are MBB001-MBB150 Wave 2 MBB participant usernames are MBB2001-MBB2150 *It is possible that Wave 3 participants will be MBB3001-MBB3150 BUT confirm with Lab Manager. Enter the Starting ID Number, and ensure that the Example contains MBBXXXX with the starting ID number you have entered. Next, enter the number of respondent accounts you require to add for the study. (Previous studies have added 150 respondent accounts). Next, the number of recalls will automatically be entered as specified in the original study details. You can leave this unchanged and click next. Confirm Study details before clicking next. Next, we will be autogenerating passwords for each respondent account. Select the option to provide a root word for each password and enter “Bablab” as the root word. (This will autogenerate passwords such as “Bablab@194”). Click Finish. ASA will generate two files with the date of creation: one file with the Usernames and Passwords, and one Template File. Download and save the Username and Password File, which will contain the autogenerated username and password information for each participant. Save this file on Box, under Bablab &gt; studies &gt; Mind_Brain_Body &gt; ID_Drive as “MBB_asa_usernames_passwords.csv” This file should remain confidential and not be paired with any identifying information. These usernames and passwords can now be shared with participants to allow them to complete the ASA task under their own respondent accounts. 4.9 Gorilla Creating Tasks on Gorilla Protocol Gorilla is an online experiment builder that allows scientists to collect behavioral data, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. It allows for building of tasks, and questionnaires, to be administered online to participants. The BABLab has commonly used Gorilla for the Halloween task as part of the Mind, Brain, Body Study. Go to the following website: https://gorilla.sc/ Log in using username and password found on the BabLab Internal Site. Once logged in, click on “Projects” to access the labs current studies. If you are working on a current study or a new wave of a current study, click on that study. If not, create a new project in the upper right-hand corner. For example, the project page for MBB contains “experiments” which are the completed experiments that participants complete, as well as “tasks &amp; questionnaires” that must be created first, and then inputted into the final experiment. IF you are updating a current project: IMPORTANT It is imperative that you do NOT edit any current tasks, questionnaires, or experiments that are in use within the lab, UNLESS explicitly instructed to do so. IF you are building a new experiment within a current study such as MBB, you may CLONE the experiment or task, so that it stays separate from previous tasks/experiments. (As seen by the naming conventions below) To clone an experiment or task, select the item you’d like to clone, and under settings, select “clone”, and rename it, following the previous naming conventions. Ex: “MBB_wave_x” or “task_wave_x” IF you are creating a new project: Select “Create a New Project” and name it accordingly. Your project will contain all of your tasks, questionnaires, and experiments. Tasks and Questionnaires are components of Experiments. To create a Questionnaire, select the “Create” button, and select the type you’d like to create. Enter a name for your questionnaire and select OK. If you’d like to clone a previous task, you have the option to do so here as well. Gorilla offers many different options for types of Questionnaires that can be included in your online experiments, as seen below. In this example, we will select “Rating Scale/Likert” This is the format you will see when creating a task. On the left, you enter the questions that make up your questionnaire, as well as any variables and titles. On the right side, you will see a live preview of how your question will appear during your experiment. For example, we have created a likert scale, where a participant can rate their experience from 1 to 5. We included the rating options of 1,2,3,4,5, and labeled 1 as worst, and 5 as best. To add additional questions within your questionnaire, you can select “Add Widget Here”, and continue your questionnaire. When you complete your questionnaire, select “Commit Version x” to save it as a completed task. You can go back and edit this questionnaire as necessary and commit the questionnaire to a newer version as well. To create a task, select the “Create” button, and select the “Task builder task” and name it accordingly. We first begin with task structure. Depending on the nature of your study, you will most likely begin with an instructions screen. Select the first + symbol, and title your first display “instructions”. The following steps are specific to your current study, but generally the next displays will be the trials in your experiment, followed by an end/debrief screen. Select the next + symbols, and enter names for each of the displays you require for your study. In this example, we’ve added a display for trials, and a display for the ending of the experiment. The instruction and end pages can be customized by clicking the “+” icon, where you can choose a template for these displays. In this example, we will select “rich text” as this is the most common display we use for providing instructions and debriefing. For your trials, you can also choose between a variety of templates, depending on the nature of your research. You can select multiple different screens in your preferred order, such as a fixation screen, followed by a screen with an image, and three buttons. Now your task will look something like this, and next you can click each display to edit them for your experiment. To customize the displays you have chosen, click on the display, and select the red box to enter the instructions for your study. You can also customize the button for participant to enter to continue through the study. Similarly, your trials page can be tailored to your study, depending on your stimuli and answer choices. The number of trials, and the content within each trial will be determined by a spreadsheet you create. Under the spreadsheet tab, click “Download Spreadsheet” to download a template for which you will enter your trial information. This spreadsheet drives the information that will be shown to the participant. This will download and xlsx file, where you can specify your display, stimuli, answers, and the randomization of the trials. Here is an example below of an experiment with instructions, three randomized trials, and an ending page. You can then upload this spreadsheet to Gorilla. **it is necessary that the displays match exactly as they are formatted in your task structure page (ex: entries are case sensitive) Any items in green have been identified and connected to your task structure – if an item is not green, gorilla has not recognized it, and it should be double-checked. Once your task looks complete, you can preview the task to test its functionality. Once you are happy with its functionality, you may commit the task to complete it. Once your task and questionnaires are completed, you can then create your experiment. Under your project, create a new experiment and name it accordingly. Your experiment page will begin with start and finish nodes. You can then select the option “+ Add New Node” to add any task or questionnaire to your study. Select the type of node(s) you’d like to include in your experiment, and drag the arrow bar to and from each node in the order you’d like your experiment to function. For example, you can include your test task in your experiment with connecting arrows, and your experiment will appear as seen below. At this point, you can preview and commit your experiment, and it will be ready to run! For additional instructions on creating a task in Gorilla, see the following instructional video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syw-7XKLCM4 4.10 Git To use GitHub and other Git applications, you will need to install Git on your local computer. Git runs in the background and performs tracking and version control for you. This is similar to the way that RStudio runs on top of R. To install Git: Go here Use the homebrew method Type this line of code into your terminal and press enter When you see the instructions RETURN - press enter again You may have to enter your password, if it looks like you aren’t entering text, you really are, so just type and press enter /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&quot; Once that has installed, type this code into your terminal and press enter brew install git Git should now be installed 4.11 GitHub Download GitHub Desktop Create new repository on GitHub Desktop Make sure to select the correct parent folder Initialize the repository If you press command + shift + . you can see the hidden git files Add your files to the folder Open back to GitHub Desktop The blue dot means there are changes in that folder to commit Publish the repository (this sets up the repository online - choose which organization it should go to) Create the first commit and publish the repository (add a comment and select your organization) Committing saves the changes to your local git (your local computer record of changes)(local changes) Push the repository Push the changes that git has catalogued to the online GitHub Go to GitHub online and you can see your repository with all of your files and latest commits Important to note that the README file will display as the main page for the repository If you click on the commits button, you can browse your entire history of commits, explore the file, and download the version from any point in it’s history Adding a .gitignore file will allow you to “skip” over certain types of files that you don’t want to commit You can change the name of the root folder on your local directory - just be sure to use the “locate” function in GitHub Desktop to locate it Make your respository public For a more thorough description of Git, see this article.

GitHub has an integrated workflow for this. Collaborative Workflow Fetch origin Create branch Code (Make sure you are working in the correct project on R) Build / Knit (Build is for Wiki’s/Books - Knit is for regular Rmarkdown files) Commit Push (and/or publish branch) Pull Merge Delete branch on GitHub online AND on local computer GitHub Desktop Repeat – The first step is to fetch origin (or clone down if this is your first time working in this repository) If fetching: If cloning: clone the repository from your organization into a local directory on your computer using GitHub Desktop - Anywhere is fine as long as it’s not a shared folder - Box, Dropbox, Google Drive folders are fine as long as you are the ONLY user (i.e. your personal Google Drive etc.) The next step in a collaborative repository is to create your own branch on the GitHub Desktop app NEVER work directly in the master branch - you might break something Name it after yourself (this will be your workspace) Now you can begin coding! (make/add/remove things etc. directly in the folders on your computer) Make sure you are working in the correct project on R Build/Knit - when you are done making your desired changes, click build or knit Commit - Commit your changes using GitHub Desktop This is kind of like saving the changes to your local computer change tracker Make sure you put a comment in the box (no description necessary) Make your comment useful to those reviewing it Push - now push your changes to GitHub.com - this is like saving your local changes online (or publish branch) Pull - Now, in order to integrate your changes with the master copy (which hosts the public facing ebsite) you need to submit a pull request. This means that you want the owner of the repository to pull in your changes to the master branch This will take you to GitHub.com, follow the instructions to create your pull request Make as detailed notes as possible on what changes you have created in this round of updates Merge - on GitHub.com, the owner of the repository will then be able to review your pull request, fix any conflicts, and merge the branch into the master. Usually, this is pretty simple if there aren’t any conflicts! After the merge - delete your branch on your local computer AND on the remote (Github.com) You can do both simultaneously by navigating to your GitHub Desktop app and pressing Mac: COMMAND + SHIFT + D Windows: WINDOWS + SHIFT + D Check the box to delete branch on remote Repeat - now before you start new work, make sure to fetch origin and repeat the process. 4.12 OSF Create a new project on OSF Title it and choose storage location (US) Navigate to the new project and click Add Ons Enable GitHub Link OSF to your GitHub account Select the repository you want to link Now all of your files are visible in the OSF project Make your OSF project public 4.13 Wiki Creation In order to properly build the wiki you will neet to install LaTex This is a huge installation, so leave plenty of time You will also need to have the bookdown package installed in R-Studio To install and load bookdown in R run the following code install.packages('bookdown') library(bookdown) Create a new project based on the wiki template (duplicate and rename for your project/study) Rename any instance of “Template” to your project’s title (open using RStudio) .Rproj itself (YOU MUST OPEN THIS PROJECT FILE TO GET STARTED) _bookdown.yml file _output.yml file index.rmd file Each .Rmd file creates a section Index is always the home page You can create subsections by creating new .Rmd files - These files use markdown syntax Create a new repository using GitHub Desktop for the wiki Move all the files from your draft into the repository folder, commit, and push Make sure to always BUILD before you commit and push so that all the necessary files are updated Go into settings in GitHub online Scroll down to GitHub pages Select master/branch/docs folder to set your GitHub Pages site to the docs folder within your bookdown files Put the link on OSF to the wiki "],["offboarding.html", "Section 5 Offboarding 5.1 Offboarding - Volunteer Research Assistant 5.2 Offboarding - Lab Manager", " Section 5 Offboarding 5.1 Offboarding - Volunteer Research Assistant 5.1.1 Offboarding Tasks - Volunteer Research Assistant Ensure all tasks on Trello have been reassigned to another active member of the lab, or completed prior to departure.
