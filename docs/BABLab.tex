Welcome to the BABLab Wiki!

In the Brain and Body Lab we are interested in how early experiences influence interactions between the brain and body, contributing to mental and physical health. We hope to use this information to improve the wellbeing of children, adolescents, and adults across the world. In other words, in the BABLab, we aim to do good science that makes a difference to people's lives, today and tomorrow.

The BABLab is directed by Dr.~Bridget Callaghan, Assistant Professor of Psychology at UCLA.

  HR Requirements

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lab Manager must consult with Bridget prior to hiring. If for any reason a non-UCLA student is brought on, a background check must be run (\textasciitilde{}\$50 each). Unless otherwise specified, the Lab Manager should refer to the RA application pool within UCLA students.
  \item
    This also applies to volunteers who have graduated from UCLA. Once a student volunteer has graduated, their status must be switched to staff volunteer and all HR paperwork should be resubmitted to reflect this change. A Background Check must also now be run, since the graduated student is technically no longer affiliated with UCLA on the date after their graduation.
  \item
    Please print, read, and complete the following forms located in Box (BABLAB/Lab/Documents/RA\_hiring\_documents/RA\_hiring\_forms\_templates/HR documents)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      RA\_volunteer\_agreement
    \item
      RA\_volunteer\_application
    \item
      RA\_volunteer\_assignment
    \item
      RA\_volunteer\_workerscomp
    \item
      RA\_volunteer\_authorization (only if a Background Check is required)
    \item
      PAF form (obtained from HR)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Each form MUST be completed thoroughly. Some persons omit information such as social security information, but if any area is left vacant, we cannot accept the forms and the volunteer will not be able to work on the UCLA campus. There must be a clear start date and a clear end date. The majority of the forms are filled out by the volunteer, but there are a few areas where the UCLA professor whose lab is overseeing the volunteer must sign and date as well.
  \item
    The volunteer may not work on the UCLA campus until all forms are filled out, signed, and submitted back to HR.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Franz Access

\hypertarget{lab-meetings}{%
\subsection{Lab Meetings}\label{lab-meetings}}

We are happy to have a range of students join us for weekly lab meeting, whether you are an official member of the lab, or are just visiting -- we want a diversity of perspectives in the lab, so join in and make your voice heard.

You might be wondering why we need a protocol for a lab meeting? The answer is simple -- to make the meetings as time efficient, cohesive, and productive as possible. To achieve that goal, we follow a structured template for weekly lab meetings:

\hypertarget{meeting-blocks}{%
\subsubsection{Meeting Blocks}\label{meeting-blocks}}

The first layer to the lab meeting structure is to have `Meeting Blocks' which focus the content of our lab meetings for set periods of time (typically 3-5 weeks) on a particular topic. The topics of the Meeting Blocks are decided as a group and will be chosen for strategic purposes (e.g., if we are writing a grant or paper on a particular topic area we might assign a meeting block to that topic, likewise -- if we are exploring measures for a new study, we could assign a meeting block to searching for a range of measures and deciding on the best available). You can find a list of potential Meeting Block topics at the end of this document. If there is a topic of high general interest to the lab, we can also schedule a meeting block on it (even if we don't directly research that topic). At the end of each meeting block we will discuss the next block assignment as a group. If you have an idea for a meeting block, feel free to bring it up at the end of the current block (and add it to the list in this bookdown project).

\hypertarget{syllabus-development}{%
\subsubsection{Syllabus Development}\label{syllabus-development}}

The first step in a meeting block will be to develop a syllabus for the coming weeks. The syllabus can either be worked on as a group (e.g., in the first meeting of a new block), or one person can be in charge of developing the syllabus.

\emph{Roles \& Responsibilities}

Select a sub-topic or research question for each meeting within the block.
Select a set of readings/material (can be movie clips, podcasts etc.) to go through each week (keep in mind that people have limited time to review the material for lab meeting so assign one primary reading/material and place add additional materials into a supplement, in case people wish to review further).
Make a document for the meeting and share it with all meeting attendees.
Make sure that people are signed up to lead each meeting in the block.
Be in charge of sending reminders for the meetings in the block.
Make any meeting notes at the end of each meeting, and make sure the paper doc is up to date at the close of the meeting.
Make a post on the BABLab twitter for each meeting so people know what we are talking and thinking about.

\hypertarget{meeting-leaders}{%
\subsubsection{Meeting Leaders}\label{meeting-leaders}}

Each meeting will be assigned a meeting leader. The leader is the person who has chosen or been assigned the primary reading or media material for that week.

\emph{Roles and Responsibilities}

Read/watch/listen to the media assigned for that week in detail.
Think about themes that can be brought up in the lab meeting to discuss as a group.
Be ready to facilitate the meeting and stimulate conversation.
Keep the meeting on track (practice those assertive conversation steering techniques!).
The meeting leader does NOT need to make slides, prepare food, or do anything else beyond the roles and responsibilities outlined above.

\hypertarget{meeting-attendee}{%
\subsubsection{Meeting Attendee}\label{meeting-attendee}}

It is not always possible to read/watch/listen to the media for every lab meeting in detail. That is why we assign one person (the meeting leader) to do a deep dive into the material each week. While a deep dive is not necessary, all meeting attendees are expected to be familiar with the media and topic of conversation each week so that they may contribute meaningfully to discussions.

\emph{Roles and Responsibilities}

Familiarize yourself with the media being presented that week. If you have time, do a deep dive too.
Be thoughtful in the lab meetings and try to make constructive comments.
If you come across additional material that you think would be good to include in the lab meeting supplement, add it into the paper doc (on Dropbox).
Try to connect the discussions in lab meeting with the past meetings in the current meeting block, as well as with discussions in past blocks.

\hypertarget{trainee-tuesdays-thursdays}{%
\subsection{Trainee Tuesdays \& Thursdays}\label{trainee-tuesdays-thursdays}}

In order to encourage ``deep work'' time, we are implementing \emph{Trainee Tuesdays and Thursdays}!

All trainings, meetings, questions/concerns that will take longer than 10 minutes (unless URGENT) should be scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays if possible.

Please feel free to schedule a meeting if you'd like to discuss your research/work more deeply or learn a new skill.

If you are simply having an issue with an assignment, before you schedule a meeting with a lab manager we ask that you try the following steps in this order:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Check the OSF protocol - there might be step-by-step instructions for your issue in the BABLab OSF or study specific OSF protocols
\item
  Watch a training video - if one exists for the issue/task at hand
\item
  Consult a fellow RA - they may know what to do
\item
  Consult a senior RA
\item
  Make a list of notes in your RA notebook about the problems you are having and present them for discussion at Thursday's RA meeting
\item
  Finally, schedule a one-on-one meeting with Emily or Kristen
\end{enumerate}

To do so, please create an event on the BABLab calendar.

Please create this event on the blue BABLab calendar using the template below during a time the lab manager is free. Invite yourself and the lab manager you'd like to meet with!

\emph{Title: Meeting - ``Meeting topic''
Description: ``Brief meeting description''
Guests: Individuals invited to the meeting}

Example:

I (Emily) have also shared my personal calendar with the BABLab account, so you can see when I am available to meet with you. You can access it by selecting ``Emily Towner'' from ``Other calendars'' in the BABLab calendar. The off-white ``busy'' slots are times I am unavailable (doctor's appointments, non lab-related meetings etc.).

\subsection{Slack}\label{slack}}

If you haven't already found this out for yourself, emails are a clunky way of communicating for most lab needs. Moreover, most people will find that they have a backlog of emails awaiting their attention. For this reason, we will use Slack for the primary means of lab communication.

The beauty of Slack is that you only subscribe to the channels that concern you. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages. If you have to include out-of-lab recipients, use e-mail. If you have a paper you want to share, download it and then upload it to Slack in the \#papers channel.

Full-time lab members should install Slack on their computers and/or phones and check it regularly (during working hours). Part-time lab members should also check Slack when they are working in the lab as there may be important messages in there for them.

Of course, if there is an emergency, and you need to contact Bridget, use her email or phone or drop into her office.

\subsection{Server}\label{server}}

In addition to Box, we make regular biweekly backups to a dedicated psychology department server (in addition to two external drives)

To connect to the CallaghanLab server:

*Contact the lab manager first to set up your credentials.

On a Mac --

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From the dropdown menu under ``Go'', select ``Connect to Server\ldots{}'' (Apple + K)
\item
  Enter the network/server address: \texttt{smb://pythia.psych.ucla.edu/Users/CallaghanLab/}
\item
  Click on ``Connect''.
\item
  A dialogue box will prompt you for your credentials. Enter your credentials obtained from Psychology IT and click on ``OK''.
\item
  If everything was entered correctly from above, the mapped drive will appear under ``Shared'' in the Mac's Finder.
\end{itemize}

On a PC --

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From the Windows file explorer, right mouse click on ``Computer'' for Windows 7 or ``This PC'' on Windows 8/10.
\item
  Select ``Map network drive''.
\item
  Specify an available ``Drive'' letter from the dropdown menu.
\item
  Enter the network/server location for the ``Folder'' field and click on ``Finish''.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Network/server location: \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}pythia.psych.ucla.edu\textbackslash{}Users\textbackslash{}CallaghanLab\textbackslash{}}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Enter your username and password that was provided by Psychology IT in the ``network credentials'' popup dialogue box and click on OK.
\item
  If everything was entered correctly from above, the mapped drive will appear under ``Network locations'' when you click on ``Computer/This PC''.
\item
  After the drive has been mapped, logged out of Windows to ``logout'' from the network drive.
\item
  Don't right mouse click on the mapped drive and select ``Disconnect''. This will only unmap the network drive and you will have to go through the process all over again.
\end{itemize}

To connect off-campus connect to the UCLA/BOL VPN and let it run in the background prior to logging into the mapped drive you had configured on your computer.

\begin{quote}
Every night the server is backed up to the Life Sciences data center in Hershey Hall. That's always been the case. To make those nightly backups more safe, there is another copy of the backups stored offsite (i.e.~to prevent losing both the server AND the backups in a fire, earthquake, etc.)

Once we have Shadow Copy enabled, we'll also have more direct access to backups, so we won't need to work with Life Sciences to retrieve backups. Psych IT will be able to grab a recent copy of your files/folders ourselves. We'll also have access to incremental backups (i.e.~yesterday's copy, two day old copy, three day old copy\ldots{}up to two weeks back).

So at that point we'll have 3 forms of backup, and plenty of safety net.

\textbf{Protocol: Adding MBB Participants to the BabLab Newsletter Google Group}

The Brain and Body Lab has a Newsletter Google Group where we send previous study participants newsletters and updates regarding the research within our lab, and it is important to consistently add new study participant emails to this list, so they can receive our newsletters!

The BabLab's Google Groups can be found Here.

Find the group called ``Brain and Body Lab News!'' -- this group contains previous study participants within the lab.

Click on the ``People'' tab to view and add new members to the group.
\includegraphics{images/lab_protocols/listserv/listserv_1.png}

Filter list by ``join date'' to view the newest members added to the group -- and locate these members on the Participant Database. This will make it clear to see when the Newsletter Google Group was last updated, and which names from the Participant database need to be added to the Google Group.

\begin{figure}

We have set up a VPN on the mac mini in the Bear Den (on the left side of the room).
Because this computer has the Acknowledge software installed on it, and has the USB Key for that program you need to use that computer for processing any physiology data. If you are off campus, you can VPN to the computer using the following steps. NB: you will need to have downloaded Cisco Anyconnect - you can access that by clicking \href{https://www.it.ucla.edu/it-support-center/services/virtual-private-network-vpn-clients}{here}

Step 1. Open Cisco and type `ssl.vpn.ucla.edu' and press `connect'

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/lab_protocols/cisco/1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Step 2. Type in your UCLA ID and Password (same as you use to get into email)

Step 3. Accept the SSO push to your second device

Step 4. Click `Accept'

Step 5. Go to the magnifying glass at the top right of your screen and search for Screen Sharing.

Step 6. Type in the IP address for the Bear Den computer: 164.67.125.42

Step 7. Type in the username and pw for the Bear Den computer:
Username - Brain \& Body Lab
PW - BaBLaB

Step 8. You will see a new window pop up, with a desktop, which is the desktop of the Bear Den computer.

A second option would be to go to the Finder on your Mac, on the top menu bar click `Go' and then click `Connect to Server'. Type in vpn://164.67.125.42. This will take you straight to the screen sharing page where you can then perform Step 7 \& 8 from above.

The pride and joy of the lab. There is a lot of content to keep track of and to ensure is posted weekly.

General important rules:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Keep posts short, family-friendly, and accessible.
\item
  If you post on the story, it should also likely be added to a story highlight.
\item
  Stick to the color scheme and aesthetic (this includes matching the text in story highlights to the story highlight cover color).
\item
  Maintain the integrity of the main feed grid (will be elaborated on further down).
\item
  Maintain the consistency of the Lab's hashtags (will be elaborated on further down).
\end{itemize}

Feed Content:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The feed grid is an important part of the aesthetic of the lab's social media. We can divide the grid into ``A Week'' and ``B Week'' rows. Because there are 3 posts horizontally in the grid, there should be 3 pieces of content posted each week (or with relative consistency).
\end{itemize}

``A Week'':

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Biome Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week's Biome Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post.
\item
  Lab Meeting ad post OR Email List ad post: Post this on lab meeting day in ``A Week''. If there is a speaker or specific topic for the week, discuss that briefly in the caption.
\item
  In ``B Week'', don't post this even if there is a lab meeting. Instead, post a previous Lab Meeting ad post on the story. If there is not a lab meeting during that ``A Week'', you should post the Email List ad post instead.
\item
  Brain Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week's Brain Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post.
\end{itemize}

``B Week'':

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  3 random posts: post pictures from around the lab, from events, or advertisements for upcoming events. Check the existing feed for ideas, and try to stay current with seasons, trends, etc.
\item
  If there is an event upcoming, use the following template to advertise it.
\end{itemize}

Important notes for all feed content:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Post all posts to both instagram and facebook (integrated feature on insta)
\item
  End every single post with the following: \#brain
\item
  Add 2-3 topical hashtags on the new line afterwards, and then follow that with the following block of hashtags: \#funscience \#psychology \#neuroscience \#research \#lablife \#ucla \#gutbiome \#dev \#psych \#brain \#body \#adolescence \#childhood \#ela \#losangeles \#scientist
\end{itemize}

Story Content:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Q\&A Monday:} every Monday, post the Q\&A Monday story with instagram's questions feature attached. Check periodically throughout the day to see if there are any questions worth responding to. Post any responses on the Q\&A story highlight.
\item
  \textbf{Biome Bites!:} A weekly fun fact about the microbiome. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight.
\item
  \textbf{Lab Meeting ad:} on lab meeting days, post one of the ad posts on the story.
\item
  \textbf{Brain Bites!:} A weekly fun fact about the brain/developmental psych. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight.
\item
  \textbf{Contact Story ad:} on Fridays, post the contact story post.
\end{itemize}

When events are coming up, be sure to post frequently on the story about the date, time, and what activities we will be doing.

There is a whole series of story templates made to show off different activities and share information regarding the event.

Where to Find the Designs:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All of the above designs for social media posts are on our canva site.
\item
  If you need to adjust any of the designs, feel free to do so.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{facebook}{%
\subsection{Facebook}\label{facebook}}

Most of the content will carry over from instagram because the accounts are linked.

Just ensure that you stay active with checking notifications and responding to comments.

Consistency across all of the lab materials is the most important thing to maintain for our online footprint.

If you are unsure of what a post should look like, check out previous posts and highlights for ideas!

\subsection{Storing Active Datasets}\label{storing-active-datasets}}

Lab data can be stored on Box, the psychology department server, and on external hard drives and CD's. Any data with personally identifying information can only be stored on non-networked, encrypted, external harddrives, flash drives, and CD's.

Although the the data is routinely backed up, the backup is only on-site -- so make extra backups! Each lab member should back up raw data on an external hard drive, as well as the code needed to reproduce all analyses. You should not store data locally on your computer (but logging into your Box/server account on your computer is ok).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{data-organization}{%
\subsection{Data Organization}\label{data-organization}}

General notes on file naming:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is very important that files are named in a clear and consistent way to avoid confusion
\item
  Generally, versions of data files, scripts, etc. that are kept in study folders are final versions, meaning that they are ``master'' copies rather than versions that are being edited by individual lab members.
\item
  If you would like to edit a script for some reason, please copy it to your user folder and rename it adding \_\textless{}your initials\textgreater{}, eg., \_fq to mark it as being edited by you. If we would like to use it for general study use, it will need to be checked and approved. If the check is successful and it is approved, only then can it replace the ``master'' script and the initials be removed.
\item
  Data should generally be named in the following way: \textless{}measure\textgreater{}\_\textless{}status\textgreater{}\_\textless{}if relevant, date in form YYYYMMDD\textgreater{}\_\textless{}if personal copy, initials\textgreater{} (e.g., cbcl\_raw\_20201118\_fq). Date is the date the data file was generated. If it was generated by a script, date needs to be updated each time the script is run.
\end{itemize}

If you have already run several independent projects and have a data organization structure that works well for you, feel free to use it. If not (or if you are looking for a change), the following structure is recommended (based on Neuropipe):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  projectName/subjects

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    individual directories for each of your participants
  \item
    projectName/subjects/\{subj\}/analysis

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      subject-specific analyses (e.g., 1st and 2nd level analysis -- at the run level and experiment level)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    projectName/subjects/\{subj\}/data

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      raw data for that participant, with the following directories\ldots{}

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        behavioralData (for, well, behavioral data)
      \item
        eyetrackingData (if applicable)
      \item
        nifti (raw nifti files / raw MRI and fMRI data)
      \item
        rois (participant-specific ROIs)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    projectName/subjects/\{subj\}/design

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      timing files for that participant, with different directories for the different GLMs you're running (and the different runs in the experiment)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    projectName/subjects/\{subj\}/fsf

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      if you're using FSL, put the .fsf fies here. If you're using SPM or something else, save the files for setting up preprocessing and GLMs here
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    projectName/subjects/\{subj\}/scripts

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Matlab, Python, R, or bash scripts that you used for that participant. You should keep the `template' scripts elsewhere, but you can store scripts you modified specifically for that participant here
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  projectName/scripts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    template scripts and that you may modify for each participant, as well as scripts and functions used for all participants and group analyses
  \item
    recommend making subdirectories for each type of analysis (e.g., behavior, pattern analysis, functional connectivity, univariate)
  \item
    if you have scripts that are the same for each participant, you can have symbolic links for them in your participant-specific scripts directories
  \item
    \textbf{naming convention for scripts}: Note that BABLab has decided on this naming conventions for scripts - \textless{}measure or study\textgreater{}\_\textless{}purpose\textgreater{}\_\textless{}if personal copy or editing, initials\textgreater{} (examples: mbb\_cleaning\_fq, cbcl\_scoring\_fq)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  projectName/results

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    figures with main results, powerpoint or keynote presentations, manuscripts if you wish
  \end{itemize}
\item
  projectName/notes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    detailed notes about the design, analysis pipeline, relevant papers, etc
  \end{itemize}
\item
  projectName/group

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    group analyses
  \item
    recommend making subdirectories for each type of analysis (e.g., behavior, pattern analysis, functional connectivity, univariate)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  projectName/task

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    code for your behavioral experiment, stimuli, piloting information
  \item
    if you are running your presentation code off of the server, it will still be good to have a copy of the code here (but you can keep the stimuli only on the server if you'd like)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

When you leave the lab, your projects directories should be set up like this, or something similarly transparent, so that other people can look at your data and code. You must do this, otherwise your analysis pipeline and data structure will be uninterpretable to others once you leave, and this will slow everyone down (and cause us to bug you repeatedly to clean up your project directory or answer questions about it).

Agreed upon organizational structure specific to MBB:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  /../Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Scripts/\textless{}wave\textgreater{}/Data: This contains all data that are used in the scripts (including raw data, inputs, and outputs of the scripts). Each file needs to be named clearly (see naming convention for data above).
\item
  /../Studies/Mind\_Brain\_Body/Scripts/\textless{}wave\textgreater{}/\textless{}purpose, eg. scoring\textgreater{}/\textless{}if necessary, sub-folder for measure\textgreater{}: scripts go here (e.g., /Scripts/Wave1/scoring/cbcl would contain script to score the cbcl)

\textbf{What is the IBC?}

The IBC is the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which has the same purpose as the IRB but specific to research involving biohazards materials. The IBC is an arm of the UCLA Environment Health \& Safety office (EH\&S).

\textbf{How to Apply for Approval}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  DBS approval and approval to collect any other biological samples is processed through UCLA SafetyNet, the IBC online system, which is the IBC's equivalent to webIRB. SafetyNet is accessible \href{https://safetynet.research.ucla.edu/}{here} with UCLA logon ID.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    IBC approval IS needed for blood samples
  \item
    IBC approval IS NOT needed for saliva, stool, or hair samples unless ---

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Saliva is collected from dental procedures
    \item
      Stool or hair samples are contaminated with blood or infected with pathogens (e.g.~HBV, HIV)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Once signed in, a new protocol is created by clicking `Create BUA'. A BUA is a Biological Use Authorization, which is synonymous with IBC protocol. Completing the BUA is just like completing an IRB protocol, but with a focus on the collection of biological samples.
\item
  A BUA (or IBC protocol) requires the following document in addition to information supplied in the online form:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lab Specific Biosafety Manual (includes the following)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Laboratory Specific SOPs (based on general template available \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/v/ehs-bio-lab-biomanual}{here})
    \item
      Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan (based on general template available \href{https://ucla.app.box.com/v/ehs-bbp-ecp-template}{here})
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{NOTE:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consultation with an EH\&S is likely necessary to complete the BUA protocol. Contact EH\&S or IBC employees with questions at \href{mailto:biosafety@ehs.ucla.edu}{\nolinkurl{biosafety@ehs.ucla.edu}} or \href{mailto:ibc@research.ucla.edu}{\nolinkurl{ibc@research.ucla.edu}}.
\item
  All EH\&S documents are available \href{https://www.ehs.ucla.edu/documents}{here}.
\item
  Additional documents may be required depending on the kind of biological material that's going to be collected.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Once a BUA is completed, it will appear under `Submissions.'
\item
  IBC staff may require that modifications be made to the protocol, just as the IRB would. You may reply to modification requests and make modifications in the same way that you would for an IRB protocol, by logging your response to a reviewers comment and then making the necessary change in the protocol itself.
\item
  Once all modifications are made, there are two more requirements before a BUA can be approved:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Staff involved in collecting biological samples must acquire necessary training

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Training may be completed via the UCLA \href{https://worksafe.ucla.edu/Ability/Programs/Standard/Control/elmLearner.wml?PortalID=LearnerWeb}{WorkSafe} portal accessible with UCLA logon ID.

    \begin{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Training must be up to date. Training certificates are maintained on the BAB Lab Box at BABLAB/Lab/Training/IBC
  \item
    A room inspection must be done to approve the use of physical space for sample collection and storage.
  \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{questionnaire-database}{%
\section{Questionnaire Database}\label{questionnaire-database}}

In Box you can find a questionnaire database for the BABLab. This is different from the study specific questionnaire folders! This database is a repository for all of the questionnaires we have used or thought about using in our research. Organizing them here makes it easy for future BABLab members to plan, organize, and reproduce studies!

This includes the questionnaires used in all of our studies, including source material. In addition, the questionnaire database excel file contains information such as a brief description and reference (needed for IRB protocols and the like).

You can find the questionnaire database at the following path:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Box/BABLAB/Lab/Questionnaires
\end{itemize}

You can find the questionnaire database spreadsheet at the following path:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Box/BABLAB/Lab/Questionnaires/Questionnaire\_database.xlsx
\end{itemize}

When making a new study, please add your questions to the database, including a category and a reference! Adding a category makes it easy to filter this sheet by category when exploring measures.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/lab_protocols/questionnaire_database/1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Please create a folder for each questionnaire within the database to allow for the organization of source material. For example, the scq (social cravings questionnaire) was adapted from the fcq (food cravings questionnaire). Therefore, in the scq folder I included the original measure for the fcq, and a paper in which it is desribed and validated. In addition, if you have created this questionnaire as an instrument in REDCap - please upload the zipped file of the instrument to this folder! This will save a great deal of time for future researchers!

\hypertarget{ecg}{%
\subsection{ECG}\label{ecg}}

Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures a subject's heart rate and waveform pattern. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal travels through the heart. This electrical wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart. ECG measures this wave through electrodes placed across the torso. By collecting ECG, you can detect changes in heart function due to certain stimuli. Things like stress, excitement, fear, and other emotional responses can be physiologically measured based on changes in the ECG readouts.

\textbf{Biopac Setup}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In our ECG setup, we have one transmitter with one channel.
\item
  The red and white leads are the signal, the black lead is the ground.
\item
  Because we are using a wireless setup, there needs to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Electrode Placement}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will be placing 2 electrodes just below the collarbones and one electrode on the lowest left rib.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Filtering and Signal Frequency}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will sample ECG at a rate of 2kHz, or 2000 samples/second. This gives us a resolution high enough to catch all of the important parts of the heartbeat waveform.
\item
  Noise is not much of an issue with collecting ECG in a 3-electrode setup.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subject Position}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position, so that body movement can be completely avoided or reduced to the minimal. The subject should be asked not to talk, move, read or make phone calls during the procedure.
\item
  Ensure that the position of the subject is the same if there are multiple sessions. Timing of unavoidable body movement or motion artifacts should be noted and the recording periods with motion artifacts must be removed before analysis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Gathering ECG Data}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Lightly abrade the skin at the electrode sites with EL-Prep Gel
\item
  Wipe off excess with a wet wipe or tissue
\item
  After prepping the electrodes with Gel-100, attach electrodes to the skin at the three positions indicated above

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Let these sit as long as possible to adhere and for the gel to soak in
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ask the participant to put on the module like a belt around their torso

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Make sure the electrode lead inputs are pointed up towards their head
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Connect the white lead to the Right Collarbone electrode, connect the black lead to the Left Collarbone electrode, and connect the red lead to the Left Rib electrode
\item
  Turn on the transmitter and ensure that both the light on the Biopac receiver module and the transmitter are green (the transmitter should be flashing, whereas the receiver should be solid)
\item
  Make sure there is a clear, unobstructed line of sight between the transmitter and receiver antenna
\item
  Open AcqKnowledge by selecting the template file on the desktop

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the system is not connected to the hardware, make sure the wifi is turned off and restart AcqKnowledge
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ensure all devices are connected and lead wires attached properly
\item
  Hit the green ``Start'' button and click through all of the dialog boxes that you're prompted with
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{egg}{%
\subsection{EGG}\label{egg}}

\textbf{Biopac Setup}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In our EGG setup we have one transmitter with two channels (A and B).
\item
  The white leads are the reference, the red are the signal, and the black is the ground.
\item
  Each transmitter needs to have a ground.
\item
  Because we are using a wireless setup, there needs to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Electrode Placement}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will place the two white electrodes side-by-side on the xyphoid (which is the lower part of the sternum).
\item
  We will place the two red electrodes in position 1 and 4 in the diagram above.
\item
  We will place the black electrode (the ground) on the second from bottom rib on the left. Try to get it over the bone as much as possible.
\item
  Position 1 should be in line with the reference electrode, and position 4 should be in line with the ground.
\item
  Next, we need to have the transmitter up high on the participants chest so there is line of sight between the transmitter and receiver (antenna).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Alternative}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Regular electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes can be used for EGG recordings.
\item
  The most commonly used configuration for recording 1-channel EGG is to place one electrode at the midpoint on a line connecting the xiphoid and umbilicus, and the other electrode 5 cm away (up and 45 degree) to the patient's left.
\item
  The ground electrode is placed on the left costal margin horizontal to the first active electrode.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Filtering and signal frequency}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Amplification}: the EGG signal is usually in a range of 50-500 μV and adequate amplification needs to be provided by a recording device so that the amplified signal is of an appropriate range for display and analysis
\item
  \emph{Filter setting}: determines the frequency range of the EGG signal to be maximally amplified. The interested range of the EGG signal is in the range of 0.5-9.0 cpm or 0.0083 to 0.15 Hz which is much lower than that of most of extracellular recordings.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In addition to the basic fundamental frequencies of 0.5-9.0 cpm, it is also important to record certain harmonics (multiples of the fundamental frequency). Accordingly, an appropriate frequency setting is in the range of 0.0083 to 1 Hz.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Skin Preparation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First, the abdominal skin where the electrodes are to be positioned should be thoroughly cleaned to ensure that the impedance between the pair of electrodes is below 10 kΩ.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To do so, it is advised to abrade the skin until it turns pinkish using some sandy skin-preparation jelly, and then apply a thin layer of electrode jelly for 1 minute for the jelly to penetrate into the skin.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Before placing the electrode, the excessive jelly must be completely wiped out.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subject Position}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position, most commonly supine, so that body movement can be completely avoided or reduced to the minimal. The subject should be asked not to talk, move, read or make phone calls during the procedure.
\item
  Ensure that the position of the subject is the same if there are multiple sessions. Timing of unavoidable body movement or motion artifacts should be noted and the recording periods with motion artifacts must be removed before analysis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Duration of Recording}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A common mistake in recording the EGG is that the recording is too short. Unlike the ECG in which there are about 60 waves every minute, the EGG is composed of only 3 waves every minute. That is, if the recording is of a short duration of 5 minutes, there are only 15 waves which are obviously insufficient for analysis and interpretation.
\item
  Ideally, at least a 30-minute period is needed to ensure an accurate measure of gastric slow waves in a particular state, such as fasting, fed, baseline or after intervention.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Meals}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will ask participants to eat something about 1 hour before they come into the lab.
\item
  Then we will give them water (as a test meal) immediately before performing the EGG.
\item
  The subjects should all drink the same amount of water.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The EGG also contains respiration artifact that is between 12-25 cpm and sometimes the ECG artifacts (＜ 60 cpm). Occasionally, the slow wave of the small intestine may also be recorded in the EGG (9-12 cpm).
\item
  Although these interferences distort gastric slow waves in the EGG, their frequencies do not overlap with that of the gastric slow waves. Consequently, spectral analysis can be performed to separate the gastric slow waves from interferences.
\item
  Before spectral analysis is performed, any periods with motion artifacts must be identified and deleted because motion artifacts can not be separated from the gastric slow waves even with spectral analysis. So we will need to record their motion during the task.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dominant Frequency and Power}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The dominant frequency and power of the EGG can be derived from the power spectral density assessed by the periodogram method. The normal range of the dominant frequency of the EGG is between 2 to 4 cpm.
\item
  The EGG is called bradygastria if its dominant frequency is lower than 2 cpm, tachygastria if its dominant frequency is higher than 4 cpm but lower than 9 cpm, and arrhythmia if there is no dominant peak power in the spectrum
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Power Ratio or Relative Electrogastrography}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Power Change}: The ratio of dominant EGG powers after and before an intervention is a commonly used parameter that is associated with alteration in gastric contractions. It is generally accepted that a ratio of ＞ 1 reflects an increase in gastric contractility due to the intervention, whereas a ratio of ＜ 1 reflects a decrease in gastric contractility.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the decibel (dB) unit is used, the ratio should be replaced by the difference between the baseline and after intervention.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Percentage of Normal Gastric Slow Waves}: The percentage of normal slow waves is a quantitative assessment of the regularity of the gastric slow wave measured from the EGG. It is defined as the percentage of time during which normal gastric slow waves are observed in the EGG. The percentage of normal slow waves can be computed from the running power spectra of the EGG.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In this method, 1 spectrum is derived from every 1 minute (or some other short period) of EGG data; the minute is considered normal if its EGG spectrum exhibits a dominant power in the range of 2-4 cpm. In humans, the normal percentage of gastric slow wave is defined as 70\%.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Percentage of Gastric Dysrhythmia}: The percentage of gastric dysrhythmia is defined as the percentage of time during which gastric dysrhythmia is observed in the EGG. It is computed in the same way as that for the percentage of normal slow waves.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is further classified into the percentage of bradygastria, the percentage of tachygastria and the percentage of arrhythmia.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{gsr}{%
\subsection{GSR}\label{gsr}}

Electrodermal response (EDR) measurements (including Galvanic Skin Response, GSR) show the activity of the eccrine sweat glands. Typically, one will place electrodes where the concentration of these glands is the highest: namely, the fingertips. The activity of the eccrine sweat glands as a response to physiological excitation (stress, fear, etc.) serves to increase the conductivity of the skin when activated. When one applies a very small electric voltage (0.5 V) between two electrodes, the manifested electrical conductance varies in direct proportion to the electric current flowing between the electrodes. For instance, if a subject is presented a stimulus and the palms start to sweat, this response indicates a highly-stimulated state. The EDR of this subject will then be higher than the subject's baseline. If another subject receives the same stimulus and the palms remain as ``cool as a cucumber,'' the EDA reading will remain unchanged with respect to the baseline. EDR undergoes relatively fast habituation (decrease of amplitude) in the event the same stimulus is repeated over and over to the same subject.

\textbf{Biopac Setup}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In our GSR setup, we have one transmitter with one channel.
\item
  The red lead is the signal, the black lead is the ground.
\item
  Because we are using a wireless setup, there needs to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Electrode Placement}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will be placing the signal electrode on the middle finger of the child's non-dominant hand.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This has been noted to be the region of the hand with the most concentrated and reactive eccrine sweat glands, and using the non-dominant ensures that the participants will be able to continue with other activities that they may be tasked with while hooked up to the GSR module.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The ground electrode can be attached anywhere within reach of the transmitter leads. While the above paper grounded to a position on the participant's arm, for the sake of consistency and simplicity, we are attaching the second electrode to the participants' index finger (on the same hand).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This provides an effective ground, consolidates the leads into one area (preventing potential interference or having the electrodes pulled off by strain on the leads), and also standardizes the placement across all the participants.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Filtering and Signal Frequency BioPac Recommendation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The sample rate can be set quite low for long-term ambulatory measurements or experiments that do not require a high level of temporal precision (i.e., 1-5 samples per second). However, lower sample rates cannot ensure that specific events are accurately represented in what is relayed and graphed, and a degree of timing error might occur.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To avoid this, BioPac recommends the sampling rate be set to a minimum of 2000 samps/sec (2KHz). Higher sample rates are useful for a number of methodological reasons and for improvements in precision.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  For EDA/GSR measurements, it is typical to filter the data at 35Hz. Some recommendations are that a sample rate of 200Hz - 400Hz are a minimum to ensure enough samples for accurate separation of phasic waveforms from tonic signals and a more accurate representation of signal shape.
\item
  A general approach is to always err on the side of caution and probably seek to sample higher than you really need. As a general rule 1000Hz - 2000Hz sample rates are more than sufficient and easily achievable. The decision for the present study is to collect at a sampling rate of 2000Hz.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subject Position}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ensure that the subject is in a comfortable position, so that body movement can be completely avoided or reduced to the minimal. The subject should be asked not to talk, move, read or make phone calls during the procedure.
\item
  Ensure that the position of the subject is the same if there are multiple sessions. Timing of unavoidable body movement or motion artifacts should be noted and the recording periods with motion artifacts must be removed before analysis.
\end{itemize}

Loading Users into ASA Protocol

ASA is a 24-hour dietary assessment tool that we use as part of MBB for participants to enter information regarding their diet and generate a nutrition report. Each MBB participant requires their own unique ASA username and password to complete this task.

To load new users into ASA:

Go to the following website: \url{https://asa24.nci.nih.gov/}

Log in using username and password found on the BabLab Internal Site.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Click on ``Respondent Accounts'' to add new accounts to ASA
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_2.png}

Click ``Start Wizard'' to set up additional account usernames and passwords.
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_3.png}

Respondent usernames will automatically begin with MBB and an ID number of your choice. Confirm with Lab Manager what the MBB ID numbers should be for the study, and how many participants accounts should be created. Because participants complete ASA for different waves, the MBB ID numbers need to be different for each Wave.

Ex: Wave 1 MBB participant usernames are MBB001-MBB150
Wave 2 MBB participant usernames are MBB2001-MBB2150

*It is possible that Wave 3 participants will be MBB3001-MBB3150 BUT confirm with Lab Manager.

Enter the Starting ID Number, and ensure that the Example contains MBBXXXX with the starting ID number you have entered.
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_4.png}

Next, enter the number of respondent accounts you require to add for the study. (Previous studies have added 150 respondent accounts).
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_5.png}

Next, the number of recalls will automatically be entered as specified in the original study details. You can leave this unchanged and click next.
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_6.png}

Confirm Study details before clicking next.
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_7.png}

Next, we will be autogenerating passwords for each respondent account. Select the option to provide a root word for each password and enter ``Bablab'' as the root word. (This will autogenerate passwords such as ``\href{mailto:Bablab@194}{\nolinkurl{Bablab@194}}''). Click Finish.
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_8.png}

ASA will generate two files with the date of creation: one file with the Usernames and Passwords, and one Template File. Download and save the Username and Password File, which will contain the autogenerated username and password information for each participant.

Save this file on Box, under Bablab \textgreater{} studies \textgreater{} Mind\_Brain\_Body \textgreater{} ID\_Drive as ``MBB\_asa\_usernames\_passwords.csv''

This file should remain confidential and not be paired with any identifying information.
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/asa/asa_9.png}

These usernames and passwords can now be shared with participants to allow them to complete the ASA task under their own respondent accounts.

\textbf{Creating Tasks on Gorilla Protocol}

Gorilla is an online experiment builder that allows scientists to collect behavioral data, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. It allows for building of tasks, and questionnaires, to be administered online to participants. The BABLab has commonly used Gorilla for the Halloween task as part of the Mind, Brain, Body Study.

Go to the following website: \url{https://gorilla.sc/}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Log in using username and password found on the BabLab Internal Site.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla2.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Once logged in, click on ``Projects'' to access the labs current studies.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla3.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

If you are working on a current study or a new wave of a current study, click on that study. If not, create a new project in the upper right-hand corner.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla4.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

For example, the project page for MBB contains ``experiments'' which are the completed experiments that participants complete, as well as ``tasks \& questionnaires'' that must be created first, and then inputted into the final experiment.

\textbf{IF you are updating a current project:}

\textbf{IMPORTANT} It is imperative that you do NOT edit any current tasks, questionnaires, or experiments that are in use within the lab, UNLESS explicitly instructed to do so.

IF you are building a new experiment within a current study such as MBB, you may CLONE the experiment or task, so that it stays separate from previous tasks/experiments. (As seen by the naming conventions below)

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla5.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

To clone an experiment or task, select the item you'd like to clone, and under settings, select ``clone'', and rename it, following the previous naming conventions.

Ex: ``MBB\_wave\_x'' or ``task\_wave\_x''

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla6.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\textbf{IF you are creating a new project:}

Select ``Create a New Project'' and name it accordingly. Your project will contain all of your tasks, questionnaires, and experiments. Tasks and Questionnaires are components of Experiments.

\textbf{To create a Questionnaire}, select the ``Create'' button, and select the type you'd like to create.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla7.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Enter a name for your questionnaire and select OK. If you'd like to clone a previous task, you have the option to do so here as well.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla8.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Gorilla offers many different options for types of Questionnaires that can be included in your online experiments, as seen below. In this example, we will select \textbf{``Rating Scale/Likert''}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla9.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This is the format you will see when creating a task. On the left, you enter the questions that make up your questionnaire, as well as any variables and titles. On the right side, you will see a live preview of how your question will appear during your experiment.

For example, we have created a likert scale, where a participant can rate their experience from 1 to 5. We included the rating options of 1,2,3,4,5, and labeled 1 as worst, and 5 as best.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla10.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

To add additional questions within your questionnaire, you can select ``Add Widget Here'', and continue your questionnaire.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla11.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

When you complete your questionnaire, select ``Commit Version x'' to save it as a completed task. You can go back and edit this questionnaire as necessary and commit the questionnaire to a newer version as well.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla12.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

To create a task, select the ``Create'' button, and select the ``Task builder task'' and name it accordingly.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla13.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

We first begin with task structure. Depending on the nature of your study, you will most likely begin with an instructions screen. Select the first + symbol, and title your first display ``instructions''.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla14.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The following steps are specific to your current study, but generally the next displays will be the trials in your experiment, followed by an end/debrief screen. Select the next + symbols, and enter names for each of the displays you require for your study. In this example, we've added a display for trials, and a display for the ending of the experiment.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla15.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The instruction and end pages can be customized by clicking the ``+'' icon, where you can choose a template for these displays. In this example, we will select ``rich text'' as this is the most common display we use for providing instructions and debriefing.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla16.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

For your trials, you can also choose between a variety of templates, depending on the nature of your research. You can select multiple different screens in your preferred order, such as a fixation screen, followed by a screen with an image, and three buttons.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla17.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Now your task will look something like this, and next you can click each display to edit them for your experiment.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla18.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

To customize the displays you have chosen, click on the display, and select the red box to enter the instructions for your study. You can also customize the button for participant to enter to continue through the study.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla19.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Similarly, your trials page can be tailored to your study, depending on your stimuli and answer choices.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla20.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The number of trials, and the content within each trial will be determined by a spreadsheet you create. Under the spreadsheet tab, click ``Download Spreadsheet'' to download a template for which you will enter your trial information. This spreadsheet drives the information that will be shown to the participant.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla21.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This will download and xlsx file, where you can specify your display, stimuli, answers, and the randomization of the trials. Here is an example below of an experiment with instructions, three randomized trials, and an ending page.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla22.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

You can then upload this spreadsheet to Gorilla. **it is necessary that the displays match exactly as they are formatted in your task structure page (ex: entries are case sensitive) Any items in green have been identified and connected to your task structure -- if an item is not green, gorilla has not recognized it, and it should be double-checked.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla23.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Once your task looks complete, you can preview the task to test its functionality. Once you are happy with its functionality, you may commit the task to complete it.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla24.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Once your task and questionnaires are completed, you can then create your experiment. Under your project, create a new experiment and name it accordingly.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla25.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Your experiment page will begin with start and finish nodes. You can then select the option ``+ Add New Node'' to add any task or questionnaire to your study.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla26.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Select the type of node(s) you'd like to include in your experiment, and drag the arrow bar to and from each node in the order you'd like your experiment to function.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla27.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

For example, you can include your test task in your experiment with connecting arrows, and your experiment will appear as seen below. At this point, you can preview and commit your experiment, and it will be ready to run!

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/gorilla/gorilla28.png}

The above method is great if you are working alone in your own repository, but it doesn't work well for collaboration, because only one git repository can be linked to a folder at one time. GitHub has an integrated workflow for this.

\textbf{Collaborative Workflow}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fetch origin
\item
  Create branch
\item
  Code (Make sure you are working in the correct project on R)
\item
  Build / Knit (Build is for Wiki's/Books - Knit is for regular Rmarkdown files)
\item
  Commit
\item
  Push (and/or publish branch)
\item
  Pull
\item
  Merge
\item
  Delete branch on GitHub online AND on local computer GitHub Desktop
\item
  Repeat
\end{enumerate}

--

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The first step is to fetch origin (or clone down if this is your first time working in this repository)
\end{enumerate}

If fetching:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/github/30.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

If cloning: clone the repository from your organization into a local directory on your computer using GitHub Desktop
- Anywhere is fine as long as it's not a shared folder
- Box, Dropbox, Google Drive folders are fine as long as you are the ONLY user (i.e.~your personal Google Drive etc.)

\begin{figure}

\caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  The next step in a collaborative repository is to create your own branch on the GitHub Desktop app

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    NEVER work directly in the master branch - you might break something
  \item
    Name it after yourself (this will be your workspace)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\centering
\includegraphics{images/research_protocols/github/29.png}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Now you can begin coding! (make/add/remove things etc. directly in the folders on your computer)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Make sure you are working in the correct project on R
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Build/Knit - when you are done making your desired changes, click build or knit
\item
  Commit - Commit your changes using GitHub Desktop

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is kind of like saving the changes to your local computer change tracker
  \item
    Make sure you put a comment in the box (no description necessary)
  \item
    Make your comment useful to those reviewing it
  \end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}

\item
  Pull - Now, in order to integrate your changes with the master copy (which hosts the public facing ebsite) you need to submit a pull request.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This means that you want the owner of the repository to pull in your changes to the master branch
  \item
    This will take you to GitHub.com, follow the instructions to create your pull request
  \item
    Make as detailed notes as possible on what changes you have created in this round of updates
  \end{itemize}

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Merge - on GitHub.com, the owner of the repository will then be able to review your pull request, fix any conflicts, and merge the branch into the master. Usually, this is pretty simple if there aren't any conflicts!
