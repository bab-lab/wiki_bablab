2. IRB Trainings- IMPORTANT
   - No one can access our Box or data until all IRB trainings are complete!
   - Create a [UCLA SSO](https://ora.research.ucla.edu/OHRPP/Documents/Education/SSO_CITI_New_Acct.pdf) for CITI Program or [login](https://www.research.ucla.edu/CITIProgram/) through UCLA

      - Please watch this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/_Ry-SnJygy8)
4. HR Requirements 
   - Lab Manager must consult with Bridget prior to hiring. If for any reason a non-UCLA student is brought on, a background check must be run (~$50 each). Unless otherwise specified, the Lab Manager should refer to the RA application pool within UCLA students.
   - This also applies to volunteers who have graduated from UCLA. Once a student volunteer has graduated, their status must be switched to staff volunteer and all HR paperwork should be resubmitted to reflect this change. A Background Check must also now be run, since the graduated student is technically no longer affiliated with UCLA on the date after their graduation.
   - Please print, read, and complete the following forms located in Box (BABLAB/Lab/Documents/RA_hiring_documents/RA_hiring_forms_templates/HR documents)
        - RA_volunteer_agreement
        - RA_volunteer_application
        - RA_volunteer_assignment
        - RA_volunteer_workerscomp
        - RA_volunteer_authorization (only if a Background Check is required)
        - PAF form (obtained from HR)
   - Each form MUST be completed thoroughly. Some persons omit information such as social security information, but if any area is left vacant, we cannot accept the forms and the volunteer will not be able to work on the UCLA campus. There must be a clear start date and a clear end date. The majority of the forms are filled out by the volunteer, but there are a few areas where the UCLA professor whose lab is overseeing the volunteer must sign and date as well. 
   - The volunteer may not work on the UCLA campus until all forms are filled out, signed, and submitted back to HR.
5. Franz Access
   - Email the lab manager to request weekend access if you will be running participants on the evenings/weekends
     - Student volunteers: Include your name and Bruincard #
     - Non-student volunteers: We will determine if you are eligible for an access card.
   - The swipe access reader is located on the right hand side of door to the right courtyard of the tower entrance.
6. BMC Requirements
   - TBD
7. Ask the Lab Manager to be added to REDCap
   - Complete and send REDCap access form to Lab Manager to be submitted to Martin Lai (mylai@mednet.ucla.edu) (BABLAB/Lab/Lab_protocols/REDCap/Access/Template/)
