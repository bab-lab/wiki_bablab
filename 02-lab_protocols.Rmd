# Lab Protocols

## Meetings and Training

----------

### Lab Meetings

We are happy to have a range of students join us for weekly lab meeting, whether you are an official member of the lab, or are just visiting – we want a diversity of perspectives in the lab, so join in and make your voice heard.

You might be wondering why we need a protocol for a lab meeting? The answer is simple – to make the meetings as time efficient, cohesive, and productive as possible. To achieve that goal, we follow a structured template for weekly lab meetings:

#### Meeting Blocks

The first layer to the lab meeting structure is to have ‘Meeting Blocks’ which focus the content of our lab meetings for set periods of time (typically 3-5 weeks) on a particular topic. The topics of the Meeting Blocks are decided as a group and will be chosen for strategic purposes (e.g., if we are writing a grant or paper on a particular topic area we might assign a meeting block to that topic, likewise – if we are exploring measures for a new study, we could assign a meeting block to searching for a range of measures and deciding on the best available). You can find a list of potential Meeting Block topics at the end of this document. If there is a topic of high general interest to the lab, we can also schedule a meeting block on it (even if we don’t directly research that topic). At the end of each meeting block we will discuss the next block assignment as a group. If you have an idea for a meeting block, feel free to bring it up at the end of the current block (and add it to the list in this bookdown project).

#### Syllabus Development

The first step in a meeting block will be to develop a syllabus for the coming weeks. The syllabus can either be worked on as a group (e.g., in the first meeting of a new block), or one person can be in charge of developing the syllabus.

*Roles & Responsibilities*

Select a sub-topic or research question for each meeting within the block.
Select a set of readings/material (can be movie clips, podcasts etc.) to go through each week (keep in mind that people have limited time to review the material for lab meeting so assign one primary reading/material and place add additional materials into a supplement, in case people wish to review further).
Make a document for the meeting and share it with all meeting attendees.
Make sure that people are signed up to lead each meeting in the block.
Be in charge of sending reminders for the meetings in the block.
Make any meeting notes at the end of each meeting, and make sure the paper doc is up to date at the close of the meeting.
Make a post on the BABLab twitter for each meeting so people know what we are talking and thinking about.

#### Meeting Leaders

Each meeting will be assigned a meeting leader. The leader is the person who has chosen or been assigned the primary reading or media material for that week.

*Roles and Responsibilities*

Read/watch/listen to the media assigned for that week in detail.
Think about themes that can be brought up in the lab meeting to discuss as a group.
Be ready to facilitate the meeting and stimulate conversation.
Keep the meeting on track (practice those assertive conversation steering techniques!).
The meeting leader does NOT need to make slides, prepare food, or do anything else beyond the roles and responsibilities outlined above.

#### Meeting Attendee

It is not always possible to read/watch/listen to the media for every lab meeting in detail. That is why we assign one person (the meeting leader) to do a deep dive into the material each week. While a deep dive is not necessary, all meeting attendees are expected to be familiar with the media and topic of conversation each week so that they may contribute meaningfully to discussions.

*Roles and Responsibilities*

Familiarize yourself with the media being presented that week. If you have time, do a deep dive too.
Be thoughtful in the lab meetings and try to make constructive comments.
If you come across additional material that you think would be good to include in the lab meeting supplement, add it into the paper doc (on Dropbox).
Try to connect the discussions in lab meeting with the past meetings in the current meeting block, as well as with discussions in past blocks.

#### Potential Lab Meeting Block Topics 

(in no particular order)

 - <s>Sensitive periods in learning and memory</s>
 - <s>Mind Brain Body Study: Questionnaires</s>
 - Role of the hippocampus in learning and memory across development
 - Nutritional Psychiatry
 - Nutrition and cognitive development
 - How does early adversity or lifetime stress affect the microbiome?
 - Bottom up: microbiome influences on brain and behavior
 - Top down: brain and behavioral influences on microbiome
 - Mind Brain Body Study: In lab task review
 - Multivariate analytical techniques in fMRI
 - Microbiome methods
 - Electrogastrograph – what do we know about the signal?
 - Heart Rate Variability and early life stress
 - Integrating physiological measures to enrich our understanding of behavior
 - Kind of crazy ideas, but wouldn’t it be cool if they worked session.
 - Research group highlight - we pick a research group (or even a general research topic) and review the body of work they engage in, or in the case of the research topic, who the big research groups in the field are.


----------

### Trainee Tuesdays & Thursdays 

In order to encourage "deep work" time, we are implementing *Trainee Tuesdays and Thursdays*!

All trainings, meetings, questions/concerns that will take longer than 10 minutes (unless URGENT) should be scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays if possible.

Please feel free to schedule a meeting if you'd like to discuss your research/work more deeply or learn a new skill.

If you are simply having an issue with an assignment, before you schedule a meeting with a lab manager we ask that you try the following steps in this order:

 1. Check the OSF protocol - there might be step-by-step instructions for your issue in the BABLab OSF or study specific OSF protocols
 2. Watch a training video - if one exists for the issue/task at hand
 3. Consult a fellow RA - they may know what to do
 4. Consult a senior RA
 5. Make a list of notes in your RA notebook about the problems you are having and present them for discussion at Thursday's RA meeting
 5. Finally, schedule a one-on-one meeting with Emily or Kristen

To do so, please create an event on the BABLab calendar.

Please create this event on the blue BABLab calendar using the template below during a time the lab manager is free. Invite yourself and the lab manager you'd like to meet with! 

*Title: Meeting - "Meeting topic" <br>
Description: "Brief meeting description" <br>
Guests: Individuals invited to the meeting*

Example: 

![<!--- Calendar Template Example --->](images/lab_protocols/trainee_tuesdays_thursdays/1.png)

I (Emily) have also shared my personal calendar with the BABLab account, so you can see when I am available to meet with you. You can access it by selecting "Emily Towner" from "Other calendars" in the BABLab calendar. The off-white "busy" slots are times I am unavailable (doctor's appointments, non lab-related meetings etc.).

### Clinical Meetings


<h4>Purpose</h4>

The purpose of clinical meetings are to discuss and review ongoing clinical interviews (KSADs), troubleshoot any recent difficulties, and learn helpful interviewing tactics for future clinical interviews. During the meeting, you will present the team with background information from your clinical interview and walk through each supplement. 

<h4>What To Prepare</h4>

Using a shared Dropbox Paper document, please prepare the following:

 - Who you are presenting
      - Participant's KSADS file
      - Date/time of session
 - Brief background 
      - Was the child bio/adopted?
        - Age of adoption
      - Was there any prenatal exposure?
      - Any trouble in school?
 - Supplements
      - Your thought process on why/why not you went through each supplements/diagnoses you have assigned
 - Personal opinions
      - What was the child participant like in the session? (note relevant behaviors for context)
 - WASI/WIAT
      - A quick overview of the participant's WASI/WIAT (admission and scores)
 - Questions for the team
    - Any situations you feel may have been difficult to address during the clinical interview

*These meetings are also a safe space to debrief potentially difficult interviews.*

----------

### Logging purchases on Trello

1. Go to the "Purchasing" board on Trello. It should be green.There are different tabs:
  - **To Return**: items that will be returned
  - **Maybe**: items that may be bought
  - **To Order**: items to order/ buy
  - **Submitted**: orders that have been submitted
  - **Placed**: orders that have been placed
  - **In Stock**: items that have arrived and are in lab

2. Add a card to "To Order" - name it with this format: **item being bought - $price**

3. Add the following labels:
  - **Budget: Nonlogged** (always log this by default)
  - **Fund** (ask lab manager whether it's Startup, R00, or other fund)
  - **Category** (ask lab manager which category)

4. Add the link of the item on 'add an attachment'. Rename the link the exact name of the item as written on Amazon (or whatever website).

5. Add a description with this format:
  - Units: (insert amount of item, ex. 20 pencils)
  - Orders: (insert how many orders placed, ex. 1 order of 20 pencils)
  - Date submitted: (insert date we submitted order)
  - Date placed: (insert date vendor has placed order)
  - Date received: (insert date we got it in lab)
  - If the card is something that may run out eventually (ex. granola bars, notebooks) add an approximate due date.

6. Whenever an item has been submitted, placed, and in stock, move the card into its respective tab. 

Watch the video for a detailed explanation.

## Technology

----------

### Slack

If you haven’t already found this out for yourself, emails are a clunky way of communicating for most lab needs. Moreover, most people will find that they have a backlog of emails awaiting their attention. For this reason, we will use Slack for the primary means of lab communication.

The beauty of Slack is that you only subscribe to the channels that concern you. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages. If you have to include out-of-lab recipients, use e-mail. If you have a paper you want to share, download it and then upload it to Slack in the #papers channel.
 
Full-time lab members should install Slack on their computers and/or phones and check it regularly (during working hours). Part-time lab members should also check Slack when they are working in the lab as there may be important messages in there for them.
 
Of course, if there is an emergency, and you need to contact Bridget, use her email or phone or drop into her office.

### Box

We have moved over to Box for our file storage service. This works very similarly to Google Drive or Dropbox, but is more secure. Additionally, each lab member can have their own account, it's free and great for collaboration!

Please download [Box Drive](https://www.box.com/drive) to use. 

1. Click download for your operating system

![<!--- Box Website --->](images/lab_protocols/box/1.png)

2. After installing, you may need to click allow in your security preferences

![<!--- Box Website --->](images/lab_protocols/box/2.png)

3. Log in with your UCLA email (make sure to accept the Box sharing request first)

![<!--- Box Website --->](images/lab_protocols/box/3.png)

4. Now you can use Box on your desktop.

![<!--- Box Website --->](images/lab_protocols/box/4.png)

5. On the web version, change your notification preferences so that you don't get an email every time someone uploads a file by unchecking the boxes below

![<!--- Box Website --->](images/lab_protocols/box/5.png)

----------

### Using Trello
1. There are multiple lists on the Tasks Board! 
<br>These include: Doing, To-do, Later and Done. 
<br>Depending on the task, simply move it to the right list once you progress with it.

- **To Do:** Current tasks to complete.
- **Doing:** Tasks currently being done.
- **Later**: Tasks not as pressing, but still must be done.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.
2. **To add a card**: Click '+ Add Another Card' under the appropriate list. There are multiple functions within this:
- You can add members, labels (useful for studies), checklist, attachment, due date and more to the back of the card. This information will show when you click on the card.
3. **Show Menu function:** This is a great way to search specific items, such as your own name for tasks, or the study for which there are tasks for, or tasks which have upcoming due dates.

----------

### Server

In addition to Box, we make regular biweekly backups to a dedicated psychology department server (in addition to two external drives)
 
To connect to the CallaghanLab server:
 
*Contact the lab manager first to set up your credentials.
 
On a Mac –

- From the dropdown menu under "Go", select “Connect to Server...” (Apple + K)
- Enter the network/server address: `smb://pythia.psych.ucla.edu/Users/CallaghanLab/`
- Click on “Connect”.
- A dialogue box will prompt you for your credentials. Enter your credentials obtained from Psychology IT and click on “OK”.
- If everything was entered correctly from above, the mapped drive will appear under "Shared" in the Mac's Finder.

 
On a PC –

- From the Windows file explorer, right mouse click on "Computer" for Windows 7 or "This PC" on Windows 8/10.
- Select "Map network drive".
- Specify an available "Drive" letter from the dropdown menu.
- Enter the network/server location for the "Folder" field and click on "Finish".
    - Network/server location: `\\pythia.psych.ucla.edu\Users\CallaghanLab\`
- Enter your username and password that was provided by Psychology IT in the "network credentials" popup dialogue box and click on OK.
- If everything was entered correctly from above, the mapped drive will appear under "Network locations" when you click on "Computer/This PC".
- After the drive has been mapped, logged out of Windows to "logout" from the network drive.
- Don't right mouse click on the mapped drive and select "Disconnect". This will only unmap the network drive and you will have to go through the process all over again.

 
To connect off-campus connect to the UCLA/BOL VPN and let it run in the background prior to logging into the mapped drive you had configured on your computer.

How-to download/install the [Cisco VPN client](https://help.bol.ucla.edu/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=kb0010923).


> Every night the server is backed up to the Life Sciences data center in Hershey Hall.  That's always been the case.  To make those nightly backups more safe, there is another copy of the backups stored offsite (i.e. to prevent losing both the server AND the backups in a fire, earthquake, etc.)
> 
> Once we have Shadow Copy enabled, we'll also have more direct access to backups, so we won't need to work with Life Sciences to retrieve backups.  Psych IT will be able to grab a recent copy of your files/folders ourselves.  We'll also have access to incremental backups (i.e. yesterday's copy, two day old copy, three day old copy...up to two weeks back).
> 
> So at that point we'll have 3 forms of backup, and plenty of safety net.
> 
> - Dave (Psych IT)

### Dropbox Paper

The lab has a shared Dropbox Paper account — which is slightly different than regular Dropbox file storage. On the Dropbox Paper, we will place collaborative documents. We will grant you access permission to various folders in the Dropbox Paper account, You may need to initialize an account with the email we grant access permission.

----------

### GitHub

The lab’s GitHub should be used to share code and data with people outside of the lab (i.e., people not on our IRB). Not all data can be shared (because of IRB restrictions) and not all data that can be shared should be shared immediately. Speak with Bridget about when to share data, and what needs to be done to the data (e.g., the level of de-identification required) before we share it. Ask the lab manager to get access to the lab’s GitHub.

Our lab manual, lab wiki, and study wikis are also hosted on our GitHub.

----------
 
### Google Calendars

The lab has many Google calendars and you should subscribe to those that make sense for your unique situation.
 
1. **BABLab:** Used for lab meetings, out of schedule meetings, birthdays, formal lab events etc.
2. **Availability:** If you are part time, please place the hours you plan to come into the lab on this calendar. If you are going to be away, please place the dates and times on this calendar. This is critical as the lab manager will use this information when scheduling people to run participants for our studies. Bridget and the core team will also put her out of office times on this calendar to help people with scheduling.  
3. **MBB:** Used for booking sessions and reminders for the Mind, Brain, Body study

### E-mail

We have an email listserv for communicating with the whole lab and individuals who subscribe to our list - including visitors and students from other labs who attend our meetings, visiting scholars, etc. 
 
The email is: **bablab@googlegroups.com**

If you are thinking about joining the lab and would like to be notified about upcoming lab meetings, please request to join the listserv. 
 
There is also a lab email account which people use to contact the lab to participate in studies (bablab.ucla@gmail.com). This email account will be staffed by the lab manager/s and they will sort the emails in specific folders within the Gmail account. If you are running a study, it is your responsibility to check your study's folder on the lab Gmail every few days and respond to participant inquiries in the "potential" participants folder in relation to your study.

## Social Media

----------

### Instagram

The pride and joy of the lab. There is a lot of content to keep track of and to ensure is posted weekly.

General important rules:

- Keep posts short, family-friendly, and accessible.
- If you post on the story, it should also likely be added to a story highlight.
- Stick to the color scheme and aesthetic (this includes matching the text in story highlights to the story highlight cover color).
- Maintain the integrity of the main feed grid (will be elaborated on further down).
- Maintain the consistency of the Lab’s hashtags (will be elaborated on further down).

Feed Content:

- The feed grid is an important part of the aesthetic of the lab’s social media. We can divide the grid into “A Week” and “B Week” rows. Because there are 3 posts horizontally in the grid, there should be 3 pieces of content posted each week (or with relative consistency). 

“A Week”:

- Biome Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week’s Biome Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post.
- Lab Meeting ad post OR Email List ad post: Post this on lab meeting day in “A Week”. If there is a speaker or specific topic for the week, discuss that briefly in the caption.
- In “B Week”, don’t post this even if there is a lab meeting. Instead, post a previous Lab Meeting ad post on the story. If there is not a lab meeting during that “A Week”, you should post the Email List ad post instead.
- Brain Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week’s Brain Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post.

“B Week”:

- 3 random posts: post pictures from around the lab, from events, or advertisements for upcoming events. Check the existing feed for ideas, and try to stay current with seasons, trends, etc.
- If there is an event upcoming, use the following template to advertise it.

Important notes for all feed content:

- Post all posts to both instagram and facebook (integrated feature on insta)
- End every single post with the following: #brain
- Add 2-3 topical hashtags on the new line afterwards, and then follow that with the following block of hashtags: #funscience #psychology #neuroscience #research #lablife #ucla #gutbiome #dev #psych #brain #body #adolescence #childhood #ela #losangeles #scientist 

Story Content:

- **Q&A Monday:** every Monday, post the Q&A Monday story with instagram’s questions feature attached. Check periodically throughout the day to see if there are any questions worth responding to. Post any responses on the Q&A story highlight.
- **Biome Bites!:** A weekly fun fact about the microbiome. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight.
- **Lab Meeting ad:** on lab meeting days, post one of the ad posts on the story.
- **Brain Bites!:** A weekly fun fact about the brain/developmental psych. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight.
- **Contact Story ad:** on Fridays, post the contact story post.

When events are coming up, be sure to post frequently on the story about the date, time, and what activities we will be doing. 

There is a whole series of story templates made to show off different activities and share information regarding the event.

Where to Find the Designs:

- All of the above designs for social media posts are on our canva site. 
- If you need to adjust any of the designs, feel free to do so. 

----------

### Facebook

Most of the content will carry over from instagram because the accounts are linked. 

Just ensure that you stay active with checking notifications and responding to comments. 

Consistency across all of the lab materials is the most important thing to maintain for our online footprint. 

If you are unsure of what a post should look like, check out previous posts and highlights for ideas!
